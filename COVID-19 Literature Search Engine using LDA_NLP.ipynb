    "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.It is a family of viruses that can cause illness, which can vary from common cold and cough to sometimes more severe disease.Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) are such severe cases with the world has facing.SARS-CoV-2 (n-coronavirus) is the new virus of the coronavirus family, which first discovered in December 2019, which has not been identified in humans before. It is a contiguous virus which started from Wuhan in December 2019. Which later declared as Pandemic by WHO due to high rate spreads throughout the world. Currently (on date 14 April 2020), this leads to a total of 120K+ Deaths across the globe, including 83+ deaths alone in Europe.Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.Pandemic is spreading all over the world; it becomes more important to understand about this spread. \n",

      "\tDuring the past three months, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has been growing exponentially, affecting over 100 thousand people worldwide, and causing enormous distress to economies and societies of affected countries. A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published, in scientific journals as well as through non-peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination. We examined all full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies. Our analysis clearly shows severe limitations in the present data, in light of which any finding should be considered, at the very best, preliminary and hypothesis-generating. Hence the need for avoiding stigmatization based on partial information, and for continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of the sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic. .

Background: Differential diagnosis and management for perforated appendicitis and non-perforated appendicitis and the infectious etiology of appendicitis are current hot topics. Methods: Field investigation for Tibetan students were carried out and reports published in English and Chinese medical journals were reviewed. The literature review included 473 patients in 7 cluster/outbreaks of appendicitis in 6 provinces and autonomous regions. All the clusters/outbreaks occurred in group living units. We found two classic entities of appendicitis with natural history from nonperforated appendicitis to perforated appendicitis and two entities of non-perforated appendicitis. In classic entities, one may represent majority of sporadic patients and the other may represent partial sporadic patients with obvious gastrointestinal manifestation. In entities of non-perforated appendicitis, one was identical to features of sporadic nonperforated appendicitis and the other one is identical to the following Tibetan students and associated with Fusobacterium. The field investigation for 120 Tibetan students with appendicitis showed that the resected appendices exhibited diffuse or focal hemorrhages and infiltration by eosinophils and by lymphocytes. Most patients had normal body temperature, white blood cell count and neutrophil count. This is a new entity of appendicitis. All rights reserved.

In this report, we present the first evidence of host range expansion in a virophage. We demonstrated that the Guarani virophage was able to spontaneously expand its viral host range to replicate with two novel giant viruses that were previously nonpermissive to this virophage. We were able to characterize a potential genetic determinant of this cross-species infection. We then highlighted the relevant impact of this host adaptation on giant viruses and protists by demonstrating that coinfection with the mutant virophage abolishes giant virus production and rescues the host cell population from lysis.

      "\tNovel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019, has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort. This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARSlike bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.\n",

We examined the 'metavirome' of four populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes collected in 2016-2017 from Manatee County, Florida. Unexpectedly, we discovered that dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV4) was circulating in these mosquito populations, representing the first documented case of such a phenomenon in the absence of a local DENV4 human case in this county over a two-year period. We confirmed that all of the mosquito populations carried the same DENV4 strain, assembled its full genome, validated infection orthogonally by reverse transcriptase PCR, traced the virus origin, estimated the time period of its introduction to the Caribbean region, as well as explored the viral genetic signatures and mosquito-specific virome associations that potentially mediated DENV4 persistence in mosquitoes. We discuss the significance of prolonged maintenance of these DENV4 infections in Ae. aegypti that occurred in the absence of a DENV4 human index case in Manatee County with respect to the inability of current surveillance paradigms to detect mosquito vector infections prior to a potential local outbreak. Since 1999, dengue outbreaks in the continental United States (U.S.) involving local transmission have occurred episodically and only in Florida and Texas. In Florida, these episodes appear to be coincident with increased introductions of dengue virus into the region through human travel and migration from endemic countries.

The significance of our finding is that it is the first documented report of non-outbreak DENV4 transmission and maintenance within a local mosquito vector population in the continental U.S.in the absence of a human case during a two-year time period. Our data suggest that molecular surveillance of mosquito populations in high-risk, high tourism areas of the U.S., may allow for proactive, targeted vector control before potential arbovirus outbreaks. : bioRxiv preprint 7 have been maintained vertically for at least one generation (but potentially more) in these Ae. 24 aegypti mosquito populations along Florida's Gulf Coast.

      "\tThe giant triton snail (Charonia tritonis) is one of the few natural predators of the adult Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS), a corallivore that has been damaging to many reefs in the Indo-Pacific. Charonia species have large salivary glands (SGs) that are suspected to produce either a venom and/or sulphuric acid which can immobilize their prey and neutralize the intrinsic toxic properties of COTS. To date, there is little information on the types of toxins produced by tritons. In this paper, the predatory behaviour of the C. tritonis is described. Then, the C. tritonis SG, which itself is made up of an anterior lobe (AL) and posterior lobe (PL), was analyzed using an integrated transcriptomics and proteomics approach, to identify putative toxin-and feeding-related proteins. A de novo transcriptome database and in silico protein analysis predicts that ~3800 proteins have features consistent with being secreted. A gland-specific proteomics analysis confirmed the presence of numerous SG-AL and SG-PL proteins, including those with similarity to cysteine-rich venom proteins. Sulfuric acid biosynthesis enzymes were identified, specific to the SG-PL. Our analysis of the C. tritonis SG (AL and PL) has provided a deeper insight into the biomolecular toolkit used for predation and feeding by C. tritonis. If a generalist predator evolves to a more a specialist diet, it is assumed that it would be accompanied by modifications of characters that permit greater efficiency in capturing specific prey species. These likely include foraging behaviors and search strategies with fine-tuned chemosensory systems, physiological processes associated with digestion and waste removal, and other features involved with prey capture 1 . Among predatory taxa the evolution of a specialized diet is likely to be strongly linked to the evolution of venoms used to subdue prey. Although the evolution of many of these characters may be difficult to trace for a species that has evolved a restricted diet, the evolution of venoms can be inferred from analyses of expression of genes encoding venom and digestion components 2, 3 . Marine organisms from a broad range of phyla, from bacteria and algae to invertebrates and vertebrates, are known to produce toxins with high chemical diversity, divergence of which is likely driven by speciation and diet 4-6 . Some examples include tetrodotoxins produced by bacteria found in the saliva of the blue-ringed octopus and puffer fish 7, 8 , potent pore-forming toxins produced by cnidarians 9 , okadaic acid produced by bacteria in marine sponges 10 , and saponins (steroidal and triterpenoid) that are produced by echinoderms 11 . Venoms, and in particular specific toxins, play multiple roles from foraging to defense and intraspecific conflict 12 . Although there are many species of predatory marine snails, studies of venom toxins have been restricted to species within the superfamily Conoidea 13 . These venomous marine cone snails synthesize a remarkable diversity of pharmacologically active small peptides (conotoxins) to enable prey capture, self-defense and intra-specific competition 14-16 .

      "\tMask ventilation and coughing during oro-tracheal suctioning produce aerosols that enhance nosocomial transmission of respiratory infections. We examined the extent of exhaled air dispersion from a human-patient-simulator during mask ventilation by different groups of healthcare workers and coughing bouts. The simulator was programmed to mimic varying severity of lung injury. Exhaled airflow was marked with tiny smoke particles, and highlighted by laser light-sheet. We determined the normalized exhaled air concentration in the leakage jet plume from the light scattered by smoke particles. Smoke concentration ≥20% was considered as significant exposure. Exhaled air leaked from mask-face interface in the transverse plane was most severe (267 ± 44 mm) with Ambu silicone resuscitator performed by nurses. Dispersion was however similar among anesthesiologists/ intensivists, respiratory physicians and medical students using Ambu or Laerdal silicone resuscitator, p = 0.974. The largest dispersion was 860 ± 93 mm during normal coughing effort without tracheal intubation and decreased with worsening coughing efforts. Oro-tracheal suctioning reduced dispersion significantly, p < 0.001, and was more effective when applied continuously. Skills to ensure good fit during mask ventilation are important in preventing air leakage through the mask-face interface. Continuous oro-tracheal suctioning minimized exhaled air dispersion during coughing bouts when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Respiratory failure is a serious complication of emerging infectious respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 1,2 , avian influenza 3 , influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection 4 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 5 . Supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and occasionally invasive mechanical ventilation are required for managing these patients 1-5 . During the major outbreak of SARS, it was found that procedures related to tracheal intubation 6 , oxygen administration ≥6 L/min, and NIV were independent risk factors for super-spreading nosocomial outbreaks affecting many healthcare workers in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China 7 . In a systematic review of aerosol generating procedures that might increase the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS to healthcare workers, mask ventilation and oro-tracheal suctioning increased the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals, CI) to 2.8 (1.3-6.4) and 6.2 (2.2-18.1), respectively 8 . In this respect, we have previously shown that the dispersion distances of exhaled plume along the sagittal and transverse planes were 200 and 220 mm, respectively, when bag-mask ventilation was attempted in a human-patient-simulator (HPS) 9 . Although the addition of a viral-bacterial filter eliminated forward leakage of exhaled air from the expiration diverter, leakage at the interface between the mask and the patient's face was increased to 340 mm along the transverse plane. It is unclear if the increased leakage along the transverse plane was due to the higher resistance with the filter or related to inefficient mask seal 9 . In addition, oro-tracheal suctioning may trigger coughing bouts that could further increase the spread of potentially infectious droplets. However, effective suction may limit the dispersion. Further studies are therefore required to examine if there are technical or human factors involved that\n",

      "\tViruses can be classified into archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryoviruses according to the taxonomy of the infected host. The host-constrained perception of viruses implies preference of genetic exchange between viruses and cellular organisms of their host superkingdoms and viral origins from host cells either via escape or reduction. However, viruses frequently establish non-lytic interactions with organisms and endogenize into the genomes of bacterial endosymbionts that reside in eukaryotic cells. Such interactions create opportunities for genetic exchange between viruses and organisms of non-host superkingdoms. Here, we take an atypical approach to revisit virus-cell interactions by first identifying protein fold structures in the proteomes of archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryoviruses and second by tracing their spread in the proteomes of superkingdoms Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The exercise quantified protein structural homologies between viruses and organisms of their host and non-host superkingdoms and revealed likely candidates for virus-to-cell and cell-to-virus gene transfers. Unexpected lifestyle-driven genetic affiliations between bacterioviruses and Eukarya and eukaryoviruses and Bacteria were also predicted in addition to a large cohort of protein folds that were universally shared by viral and cellular proteomes and virus-specific protein folds not detected in cellular proteomes. These protein folds provide unique insights into viral origins and evolution that are generally difficult to recover with traditional sequence alignment-dependent evolutionary analyses owing to the fast mutation rates of viral gene sequences.\n",

These patients travelled with a group of 29 other Dutch travellers. We conducted an epidemiological assessment of the travel group to identify likely source(s) of infection and presence of potential risk factors. Methods: All travellers, including the two cases, completed a questionnaire focussing on potential human, animal and food exposures to MERS-CoV. The questionnaire was modified from the WHO MERS-CoV questionnaire, taking into account the specific route and activities of the travel group. Results: Twelve non-cases drank unpasteurized camel milk and had contact with camels. Most travellers, including one of the two patients (Case 1), visited local markets, where six of them consumed fruits. Two travellers, including Case 1, were exposed to coughing patients when visiting a hospital in Medina. Four travellers, including Case 1, visited two hospitals in Mecca. All travellers had been in contact with Case 1 while he was sick, with initially non-respiratory complaints. The cases were found to be older than the other travellers and both had co-morbidities. Conclusions: This epidemiological study revealed the complexity of MERS-CoV outbreak investigations with multiple potential exposures to MERS-CoV reported such as healthcare visits, camel exposure, and exposure to untreated food products. Exposure to MERS-CoV during a hospital visit is considered a likely source of infection for Case 1 but not for Case 2. For Case 2, the most likely source could not be determined. Exposure to MERS-CoV via direct contact with animals or dairy products seems unlikely for the two Dutch cases. Furthermore, exposure to a common but still unidentified source cannot be ruled out.

      "\tTo truly elucidate the role of bats as reservoirs for arboviruses, field surveillance studies documenting natural infection and transmission dynamics among vector and vertebrate species must be supplemented with experimental infections to characterize viremia profiles and infectiousness to vectors, virus-induced pathology, and immune kinetics following infection. With bats, these tasks are not trivial, and carry significant challenges in both the field and the lab. These challenges are evidenced by the few arboviruses for which there are substantial field and laboratory data involving the infection of bats. While many studies have presented serologic data indicative of past exposure of free-ranging bats to arboviruses of medical and veterinary importance, these studies should be followed up with laboratory assessments of reservoir host competence to shed light on the true epidemiological significance of the field data. Further, the detection of viral nucleic acid in free-ranging bats does not necessarily implicate the species as an arboviral reservoir. Rather, recovery and isolation of live virus at biologically relevant titers, and demonstrating the persistence of the pathogen in nature among connected populations of a potential reservoir species is more definitive. Unfortunately, few established bat colonies exist for use in vivo viral pathogenesis studies, limiting the achievability of these studies. To fulfill the vertebrate reservoir host paradigm, in vivo infections must support findings in the field. The isolation of Marburg virus from Egyptian rousette bats in Uganda in addition to experimental infections demonstrating viremia and shedding in the absence of overt pathology support the role of this bat species as the reservoir for Marburg virus [6, 7, 208] . For arboviruses, the combination of field work and in vivo pathogenesis studies are lacking. Still, several examples have emerged from this review that point to bats as potentially competent amplifying hosts for arboviruses. Kaeng Khoi virus was isolated from both bats and cimicid bugs in Thailand, and was also shown to be the causative agent behind sick mine workers [21] . Some bat species did develop a viremia at a level that would be infectious to mosquitoes when inoculated experimentally with CHIKV, and bats have been found exposed to CHIKV during field investigations [66, 143] . Experimental evidence supporting transmission of RRV from Pteropus poliocephalus to recipient mosquitoes in addition to identification of RRV-seropositive bats trapped in Australia and Indonesia highlights the need for further investigation into the role of bats in the ecology of this disease [75, 149, 157] . A mosquito-bat-mosquito transmission cycle was established in the lab for JBEV [67] . Serological evidence from the field documenting bat exposure to JBEV, the sustained viremia in bats during hibernation, and demonstration of mosquito transmission from and to bats in the laboratory collectively demonstrate the capability of bats to function as reservoir hosts for this virus. Circumstantial evidence from field-sampled mosquitoes and bats supports the cycling of Babanki virus among bats and mosquitoes in Uganda [29] , but experimental data are still lacking.

In the township of Ve Golokuati in Ghana, several \"camps\" of Epomophorus gambianus roost in fruit trees that provide ecosystems services for residents. This study explored human-bat interaction in the township and the potential risks of disease transmission from bats to humans. Data were derived through questionnaire administration and participatory appraisal approach involving focus group discussions, participatory landscape mapping, and transect walk. The study found that most human activities within the township, such as petty-trading, domestic chores, and children's outdoor recreation, exposed people to bats. Though there have been no reported cases of disease spillover from bats to humans from the perspective of residents and from medical records, respondents whose activities brought them closer to bats within the township were found to be more likely to experience fevers than those who do not interact with bats frequently. The study recommends education of community members about the potential risks involved in human-bat interactions and makes suggestions for reducing the frequent interactions with and exposure to bats by humans.\n",

      "\tMask ventilation and coughing during oro-tracheal suctioning produce aerosols that enhance nosocomial transmission of respiratory infections. We examined the extent of exhaled air dispersion from a human-patient-simulator during mask ventilation by different groups of healthcare workers and coughing bouts. The simulator was programmed to mimic varying severity of lung injury. Exhaled airflow was marked with tiny smoke particles, and highlighted by laser light-sheet. We determined the normalized exhaled air concentration in the leakage jet plume from the light scattered by smoke particles. Smoke concentration ≥20% was considered as significant exposure. Exhaled air leaked from mask-face interface in the transverse plane was most severe (267 ± 44 mm) with Ambu silicone resuscitator performed by nurses. Dispersion was however similar among anesthesiologists/ intensivists, respiratory physicians and medical students using Ambu or Laerdal silicone resuscitator, p = 0.974. The largest dispersion was 860 ± 93 mm during normal coughing effort without tracheal intubation and decreased with worsening coughing efforts. Oro-tracheal suctioning reduced dispersion significantly, p < 0.001, and was more effective when applied continuously. Skills to ensure good fit during mask ventilation are important in preventing air leakage through the mask-face interface. Continuous oro-tracheal suctioning minimized exhaled air dispersion during coughing bouts when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Respiratory failure is a serious complication of emerging infectious respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 1,2 , avian influenza 3 , influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection 4 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 5 . Supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and occasionally invasive mechanical ventilation are required for managing these patients 1-5 . During the major outbreak of SARS, it was found that procedures related to tracheal intubation 6 , oxygen administration ≥6 L/min, and NIV were independent risk factors for super-spreading nosocomial outbreaks affecting many healthcare workers in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China 7 . In a systematic review of aerosol generating procedures that might increase the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS to healthcare workers, mask ventilation and oro-tracheal suctioning increased the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals, CI) to 2.8 (1.3-6.4) and 6.2 (2.2-18.1), respectively 8 . In this respect, we have previously shown that the dispersion distances of exhaled plume along the sagittal and transverse planes were 200 and 220 mm, respectively, when bag-mask ventilation was attempted in a human-patient-simulator (HPS) 9 . Although the addition of a viral-bacterial filter eliminated forward leakage of exhaled air from the expiration diverter, leakage at the interface between the mask and the patient's face was increased to 340 mm along the transverse plane. It is unclear if the increased leakage along the transverse plane was due to the higher resistance with the filter or related to inefficient mask seal 9 . In addition, oro-tracheal suctioning may trigger coughing bouts that could further increase the spread of potentially infectious droplets. However, effective suction may limit the dispersion. Further studies are therefore required to examine if there are technical or human factors involved that\n",

It remains a rare cause of disease in a geographically defined region of the world known for the concurrent presence of infected camel hosts. Much of what we know about MERS relates to severe disease. Travel-related cases continue to challenge the rest of the world's surveillance and response capabilities, and we need more data to understand unexplained primary transmission. Signs of genetic change in MERS-CoV have been recorded, but it remains unclear whether they change clinical disease. How camels came to carry the virus they live with today remains unknown, but it is academic for the control of MERS. To date, human-to-human transmission has been inefficient, but virus surveillance and characterisation will ensure any change to the status quo is identified. MERS-CoV is not currently a pandemic threat; it is spread with the aid of human habit and error. Nevertheless, a much needed therapeutic toolbox is being developed, and in this process we are learning more about how CoVs cause disease, how they confound our immune responses, where they come from, and how to prevent and treat their respiratory infections [90] . Focused research is needed to minimise the impact of MERS, basing control strategies on evidence gleaned from specifically addressing relevant unknowns.\n",

      "\tHuman dengue viruses emerged from primate reservoirs, yet paradoxically dengue does not reach high titers in primate models. This presents a unique opportunity to examine the genetics of spillover versus reservoir hosts. The dengue virus 2 (DENV2) -encoded protease cleaves human STING, reducing type I interferon production and boosting viral titers in humans. We find that both human and sylvatic (reservoir) dengue viruses universally cleave human STING, but not the STING of primates implicated as reservoir species. The special ability of dengue to cleave STING is thus specific to humans and a few closely related ape species. Conversion of residues 78/79 to the human-encoded 'RG' renders all primate (and mouse) STINGs sensitive to viral cleavage. Dengue viruses may have evolved to increase viral titers in the dense and vast human population, while maintaining decreased titers and pathogenicity in the more rare animals that serve as their sustaining reservoir in nature.\n",

Extensive efforts are required to speed up the development of an effective therapy and vaccine. Repurposing of currently available pharmaceutical agents is highly desirable for a more rapid drug development. Meanwhile, HCWs who encounter patients with respiratory symptoms who have lived or traveled to areas with MERS-CoV should have a low threshold to consider a diagnosis of MERS-CoV, with testing and immediate implementation of proper infection control practices to prevent further spread. Finally, given the important role that camels may play in transmission of the virus, the common practices in the Arabian Peninsula of herding and consuming unpasteurized camels' milk should be discouraged until conclusive evidence is obtained that such practices do not contribute to infection.\n",

      "\tBackground: Avian H5N1 influenza viruses present a challenge in the laboratory environment, as they are difficult to collect from the air due to their small size and relatively low concentration. In an effort to generate effective methods of H5N1 air removal and ensure the safety of laboratory personnel, this study was designed to investigate the characteristics of aerosolized H5N1 produced by laboratory manipulations during research studies. Results: Normal laboratory procedures used to process the influenza virus were carried out independently and the amount of virus polluting the on-site atmosphere was measured. In particular, zootomy, grinding, centrifugation, pipetting, magnetic stirring, egg inoculation, and experimental zoogenetic infection were performed. In addition, common accidents associated with each process were simulated, including breaking glass containers, syringe injection of influenza virus solution, and rupturing of centrifuge tubes. A micro-cluster sampling ambient air pollution collection device was used to collect air samples. The collected viruses were tested for activity by measuring their ability to induce hemagglutination with chicken red blood cells and to propagate in chicken embryos after direct inoculation, the latter being detected by reverse-transcription PCR and HA test. The results showed that the air samples from the normal centrifugal group and the negative-control group were negative, while all other groups were positive for H5N1. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there are numerous sources of aerosols in laboratory operations involving H5N1. Thus, laboratory personnel should be aware of the exposure risk that accompanies routine procedures involved in H5N1 processing and take proactive measures to prevent accidental infection and decrease the risk of virus aerosol leakage beyond the laboratory.\n",

      "\tMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is one of the major threats to the healthcare systems in some countries, especially in the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV is considered an ideal example of the One Health concept. This is due to the animals, especially dromedary camels, play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus, and the virus can be transmitted through aerosols of infected patients into the environment. However, there is some debate regarding the origin of MERS-CoV either from bats or other unknown reservoirs. The dromedary camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date. These animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secreting it in their body fluids, especially in nasal and rectal discharges. MERS-CoV has been detected in the nasal and rectal secretions of infected camels, and MERS-CoV of this origin has full capacity to infect human airway epithelium in both in vitro and in vivo models. Other evidence confirms the direct transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans, though the role of camel meat and milk products has yet to be well studied. Human-to-human transmission is well documented through contact with an active infected patient or some silently infected persons. Furthermore, there are some significant risk factors of individuals in close contact with a positive MERS-CoV patient, including sleeping in the same patient room, removing patient waste (urine, stool, and sputum), and touching respiratory secretions from the index case. Outbreaks within family clusters have been reported, whereby some blood relative patients were infected through their wives in the same house were not infected. Some predisposing genetic factors favor MERS-CoV infection in some patients, which is worth investigating in the near future. The presence of other comorbidities may be another factor. Overall, there are many unknown/confirmed aspects of the virus/human/animal network. Here, the most recent advances in this context are discussed, and the possible reasons behind the emergence and sustainability of MERS-CoV in certain regions are presented. Identification of the exact mechanism of transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans and searching for new reservoir/s are of high priority. This will reduce the shedding of the virus into the environment, and thus the risk of human infection can be mitigated.\n",

Therefore, the importance of the airborne route in a clinical context is difficult to determine. The aim of this study was to design a chamber system to study the airborne transmission of viruses between ferrets. Methods: A system composed of three chambers connected in series, each one housing one ferret and preventing direct contact, was designed. The chambers were designed to house the ferrets for several days and to study the transmission of viruses from an infected (index) ferret to two naïve ferrets via aerosols and droplets or aerosols only. A particle separator was designed that can be used to modulate the size of the particles traveling between the chambers. The chamber system was validated using standard dust as well as with ferrets infected with influenza A virus. Conclusions: The 50% efficiency cut-off of the separator could be modulated between a 5-µm and an 8-µm aerodynamic diameter. In the described setup, influenza A virus was transmitted through the aerosol route in two out of three experiments, and through aerosols and droplets in all three experiments.\n",

      "\tThis paper describes a chamber system that can be used for airborne disease transmission studies. The system is airtight and particle size distribution through the system is satisfactory (no significant difference was found for particles <420 nm). The particle separator D 50 can be modulated between 5.07 and 7.8 µm by changing the airflow. To further reduce the D 50 , plates with smaller holes could replace the actual hole plates of the particle separator. This would lead to more accelerated particles and, therefore, more particles being captured by the impaction plates. Ferrets can be used as models for the study of many mammalian viruses, including filovirus [18] , respiratory syncytial virus [19] and Morbillivirus [20] . Therefore, the studies that can be conducted in this chamber system are not limited to influenza viruses. Moreover, this cage system can be adapted to accommodate other animals like rats or rabbits. Indeed, smaller, regular cages can be placed inside the ventilated airtight cages.\n",

However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS. Methods: Data on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS. Measurements and main results: As of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic. NCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective. However, the efforts are needed to persist in for reducing time-varying reproduction number below one. now named as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As a novel virus, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP remain unclear, and it is also important to compare it with SARS. What This Study Adds to the Field: We compared the transmission dynamics of NCP with SARS, and found that NCP has a higher transmissibility than SARS. Time-varying production number indicates that rigorous control measures taken by governments are effective across China, and persistent efforts are needed to be taken for reducing instantaneous reproduction number below one. author/funder.

      "\tBackground. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now pandemic. Reliable estimates of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are essential to guide control efforts and to plan health care system requirements. The objectives of this study are to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) give estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for bias in the two regions with the world's highest numbers of confirmed Covid-19 deaths: Hubei province, China and northern Italy. Method and Findings. We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases; preferential ascertainment of severe cases and delayed mortality (right-censoring). We fitted our transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province (1 January to 11 February 2020) and northern Italy (8 February to 3 March 2020). Overall mortality among all symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was estimated to be 3.0% (95% credible interval: 2.6-3.4%) in Hubei province and 3.3% (2.0-4.7%) in northern Italy. Mortality increased with age; we estimate that among 80+ year olds, 39.0% (95%CrI: 31.1-48.9%) in Hubei province and 89.0% (95%CrI: 56.2-99.6%) in northern Italy dies or will die. Limitations are that the model requires data recorded by date of onset and that sex-disaggregated mortality was not available. Conclusions. We developed a mechanistic approach to correct the crude CFR for bias due to right-censoring and preferential ascertainment and provide adjusted estimates of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection by age group. While specific to the situation in Hubei, China and northern Italy during these periods, these findings will help the mitigation efforts and planning of resources as other regions prepare for SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.\n",

Among the 18 regions of Henan, Xinyang is with the heaviest epidemic, and it is currently also with the highest daily increment. We found that 55% patients in Henan were male, which is apparently higher than the females. We found that the gender difference of patients in Henan is 1.2226 : 1, while from Yang et al. [4] , they reported that the gender difference for 4021 patients from over 30 provinces is 0.31 : 0.27 = 1.1481 : 1. Our result is close to the existing ones. We reported that the MFRs of the whole province and its 18 regions are not the main factor that results to the gender difference in patients. Two possible main factors that result to such gender difference of patients include 1) the expression and distribution of ACE2s were wider in male patients than those in females, and 2) males are more active and with wider social activities than females in many regions of Henan. The ages of patients generally follow normal distribution, and with more than 81% patients are aged between 21 and 60 years old. N a n y a n g C e n tr a l H o s p . Incubation period is very important but very difficult to be estimated, since it is difficult to know when the patients were infected. We define the period from firstly contacting with suspicious persons or recently return from Wuhan to firstly appearing clinical symptoms (fever, cough etc) as incubation period, and we estimate its distribution. Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the average estimated incubation period was 7.4 days, the mode was 4 days. About 55% patients were with incubation periods lower than 7 days, while more than 92% patients were lower than 14 days. About 7.45% patients were overestimated with more than 14 days incubation periods. Based on ME, OLS and MLE approaches, we modeled the incubation period as logarithmic normal distributions, and we found the ME method can well mimic the long right tails of the PDF for the incubation periods. Based on the ME approach, interquartile range of theoretically estimated incubation period is between 4.1 and 9.4 days. It is noted that, due to .

      "\tBackground: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is driving many countries to adopt global isolation measures in an attempt to slow-down its spread. These extreme measures are associated with extraordinary economic costs. Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of global isolation of the whole population to focused isolation of individuals at high risk of being exposed, augmented by thorough PCR testing. Design: We applied a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (SEIR) model to compare two different strategies in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Data sources and target population: We modeled the dynamics in Israel, a small country with ~ 9 million people. Interventions: 1. Global isolation of the whole population (strategy 1) 2. Focused isolation of people at high risk of exposure with extensive PCR testing (strategy 2). Outcome measures: Number of deaths and the cost per one avoided death in strategy 1 vs 2. The number of expected deaths is 389 in strategy 1versus 432 in strategy 2. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in case of adhering to global isolation will be $ 102,383,282 to prevent one case of death. The ICER value is between $ 22.5 million to over $280 million per one avoided death. Conclusions: According to our model, global isolation will save ~43 more lives compared to a strategy of focused isolation and extensive screening. This benefit is implicated in tremendous costs that might result in overwhelming economic effects. Limitations: Compartment models do not necessarily fit to countries with heterogeneous populations. In addition, we rely on current published parameters that might not reliably reflect infection dynamics. All rights reserved.

      "\tA majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread. The novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 quickly spread to all Chinese provinces and, as of February 6, 2020, to 24 other countries 1, 2 . Efforts to contain the virus are ongoing; however, given the many uncertainties regarding pathogen transmissibility and virulence, the effectiveness of these efforts is unknown. The fraction of undocumented but infectious cases is a critical epidemiological characteristic that modulates the pandemic potential of an emergent respiratory virus 3−6 . These undocumented infections often experience mild, limited or no symptoms and hence go unrecognised, and, depending on their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to virus than would otherwise occur. Here, to assess the full potential of COVID-19, we use a modelinference framework to estimate the contagiousness and proportion of undocumented infections in China during the weeks before and after the shutdown of travel in and out of Wuhan.\n",

      "\tThe number of COVID-19 cases is continuously increasing in different countries (as of March 2020) including the Philippines. It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4. The basic reproductive number characterizes the average number of persons that a primary case can directly infect in a population full of susceptible individuals. However, there can be superspreaders that can infect more than this estimated basic reproductive number. In this study, we formulate a conceptual mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume that the general public has a reproductive number between 1.5 to 4, and frontliners (e.g. healthcare workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers) have a higher reproduction number. Our simulations show that both the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against the disease. Protecting only the frontliners will not result in flattening the epidemic curve. Protecting only the general public may flatten the epidemic curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which may eventually affect their work. Our simple model does not consider all factors involved in COVID-19 transmission in a community, but the insights from our model results remind us of the importance of community effort in controlling the transmission of the disease. All in all, the take-home message is that everyone in the community, whether a frontliner or not, should be protected or should implement preventive measures to avoid being infected.

The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations.

Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 250,000 confirmed cases as of March 21, 2020. An open-label clinical trial has just concluded, suggesting improved resolution of viremia with use of two existing therapies: hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as monotherapy, and in combination with azithromycin (HCQ-AZ). [1, 2]. The results of this important trial have major implications for global policy in the rapid scale-up and response to this pandemic. The authors present results with p-values for differences in proportions between the study arms, but their analysis is not able to provide effect size estimates. To address this gap, more modern analytical methods including survival models, have been applied to these data, and show modest to no impact of HCQ treatment, with more significant effects from the HCQ-AZ combination, potentially suggesting a role for co-infections in COVID-19 pathogenesis. The trial of Gautret and colleagues, with consideration of the effect sizes, and p-values from multiple models, does not provide sufficient evidence to support wide-scale rollout of HCQ monotherapy for the treatment of COVID-19; larger randomzied studies should be considered. However, these data do suggest further study of HCQ-AZ combination therapy should be prioritized as rapidly as possible.\n",

Vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response. Overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.\n",

      "\tBackground: Evidence points to the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like disease. In response, the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics remains a clinical priority. To accomplish this, it is necessary to evaluate neutralizing antibodies and screen for MERS-CoV entry inhibitors. Methods: In this study, we produced a pseudovirus bearing the full-length spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV in the Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 backbone. We then established a pseudovirus-based inhibition assay to detect neutralizing antibodies and anti-MERS-CoV entry inhibitors. Results: Our results demonstrated that the generated MERS-CoV pseudovirus allows for single-cycle infection of a variety of cells expressing dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), the confirmed receptor for MERS-CoV. Consistent with the results from a live MERS-CoV-based inhibition assay, the antisera of mice vaccinated with a recombinant protein containing receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues 377-662) of MERS-CoV S fused with Fc of human IgG exhibited neutralizing antibody response against infection of MERS-CoV pseudovirus. Furthermore, one small molecule HIV entry inhibitor targeting gp41 (ADS-J1) and the 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified human serum albumin (HP-HSA) could significantly inhibit MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection. Conclusion: Taken together, the established MERS-CoV inhibition assay is a safe and convenient pseudovirus-based alternative to BSL-3 live-virus restrictions and can be used to rapidly screen MERS-CoV entry inhibitors, as well as evaluate vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV.\n",

However, their clinical development has been hindered by the lack of a robust animal model that recapitulate the morbidity and mortality of human infections. We assessed the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of m336 by using well-characterized transgenic mice shown to be highly sensitive to MERS-CoV infection and disease. We found that mice treated with m336 prior to or post lethal MERS-CoV challenging were fully protected, compared to control mice which sufferered from profound weight loss and uniform death within days after infection.

      "\tMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an infectious virus that was first reported in 2012. The MERS-CoV genome encodes four major structural proteins, among which the spike (S) protein has a key role in viral infection and pathogenesis. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein contains a critical neutralizing domain and is an important target for development of MERS vaccines and therapeutics. In this review, we describe the relevant features of the MERS-CoV S-protein RBD, summarize recent advances in the development of MERS-CoV RBD-based vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, and illustrate potential challenges and strategies to further improve their efficacy. MERS-CoV, particularly neutralizing antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV infection, have been detected in the sera of dromedary camels from a number of countries and regions, with high positive detection rates [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . In addition to camel-to-camel transmission of MERS-CoV, camel-to-human transmission can occur via direct or indirect contact with sick animals [35] . There is a high prevalence of MERS-CoV infection in camel workers, particularly in Saudi Arabia [27] . Following infection of individuals, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV occurs frequently, and mainly contributes to community or healthcare-associated outbreaks [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Infection of humans by MERS-CoV, which mainly occurs through the lower respiratory tract, causes severe respiratory symptoms, leading to failure of the respiratory system and/or other organs [7, 46, 47] . On rare occasions, the human intestinal tract can be an alternative infection route [46, 48] . Anti-MERS-CoV antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, are found in infected patients, some of whom have persistently presented such antibodies for up to 34 months after the disease outbreak [49, 50] . Antibody responses, and particularly neutralizing antibody responses, are crucial factors in the successful treatment of MERS-CoV infections in humans [50] [51] [52] . In this regard, the plasma of convalescent MERS-CoV-infected patients is useful for treatment of MERS-CoV infection clinically, but it requires a neutralizing antibody titer (e.g., 50% plaque-reduction neutralization titer: PRNT 50 ) ≥1:80 to obtain effective therapeutic results [51] [52] [53] . Currently, a human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) that is produced by transchromosomic cattle immunized with a MERS-CoV vaccine [54], as well as several vaccine candidates (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03399578; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03615911) [55], have been tested in human clinical trials. However, as yet no vaccines or therapeutic agents have been approved for the prevention or treatment of MERS, indicating the need for further development of novel and effective vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection. In the following review, we will briefly describe MERS-CoV spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and summarize recent advances in the development of RBD-based MERS-CoV vaccines and therapeutics, as well as the potential challenges and future expectations for their successful development. MERS-CoV belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, as does the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV [56, 57] . MERS-CoV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome that encodes the structural proteins S, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) translated from open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b, and several accessory proteins, such as 3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b ( Figure 1A ,B) [58] [59] [60] [61] . The functions of these proteins have been elucidated. As an example, nsp1 is known to have an endonucleolytic RNA-cleavage function in the promotion of infectious virus particle production in human cells [62] , and it also participates in efficient viral replication through interaction with viral RNA, probably via a cis-acting element at the 5 -terminal coding region [63] . Evidence indicates that nsp16 is necessary for interferon resistance and viral pathogenesis [64], whereas nsp15 is a nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, the structure of which has recently been resolved, and its activity may be mediated by catalytic residues, oligomeric assembly, or RNA-binding efficiency [65] . In addition, 4a protein recognizes and binds double-stranded (ds)RNA, in which four residues of the protein might be crucial for 4a-dsRNA stability [66] , and it also inhibits protein kinase R-mediated antiviral stress responses [67] . 4a mediated-inhibition of stress-granule formation may facilitate viral translation, resulting in efficient MERS-CoV replication [68]. The MERS-CoV 4b protein interferes with the NF-κB-dependent innate immune response during infection [69]. Viruses 2019, 11, 60 3 of 18 Viruses 2018, 10, 3 Viruses 2019, 11, 60 4 of 18 events [87] . In configurations with one, two, or three RBDs rotated out, RBD determinants are exposed at the apex of the RBD-DPP4 complex, and they are accessible for interaction with DPP4 ( Figure 3) [87].

The function and structure of the S-protein RBD demonstrate that it is an important target for development of vaccines and therapeutic agents against MERS-CoV. A number of MERS vaccines have been developed based on viral RBD, including nanoparticles, virus-like particles (VLPs), and recombinant proteins, and their protective efficacy has been evaluated in animal models, including mice with adenovirus 5 (Ad5)-directed expression of human DPP4 (Ad5/hDPP4), hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice, and non-human primates (NHPs) [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] . Features of these RBD-based vaccines, in terms of functionality, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and protective ability, are shown in Table 1 .\n",

Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R 0 , to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other travel hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV.\n",

      "\tThere is an urgent need to project how transmission of the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 will unfold in coming years. These dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of immunity, and the strength of cross-immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Main text. The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has caused nearly 80,000 detected cases of COVID-19 illness and claimed over 2,500 lives as of 24 Feb 2020 (1). With sustained transmission reported in China, Japan, Iran, Italy, and South Korea (1), the outbreak is on the verge of becoming a pandemic. The required intensity, duration, and urgency of public health responses will depend on how the initial pandemic wave unfolds and on the subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. One possibility is that SARS-CoV-2 will follow its closest genetic relative, SARS-CoV, and be eradicated by intensive public health measures after causing a brief but intense epidemic (2). Increasingly, public health authorities consider this scenario unlikely (3). Alternatively, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could resemble that of pandemic influenza by circulating seasonally after causing an initial global wave of infection (4). Such a scenario could reflect the previous emergence of known human coronaviruses from zoonotic origins e.g. human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 (5). This paper identifies viral, environmental, and immunologic factors which in combination will determine which scenarios in fact play out, and identifies key data needed to distinguish between them. The transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will depend on factors including the degree of seasonal variation in transmission strength, the duration of immunity, and the degree of cross-immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus, which includes the SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, and two other human coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. The SARS and MERS coronaviruses cause severe illness with case fatality rates of 9 and 36% respectively, but the transmission of both has remained limited (6). HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 infections may be asymptomatic or associated with mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness; these HCoVs are considered the second most common cause of the common cold (6). While investigations into the spectrum of illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing, recent evidence indicates the majority of cases experience mild illness with more limited occurrence of severe lower respiratory infection (7). Current COVID-19 case fatality rates in China are estimated at 2.9% within Hubei province, and 0.4% outside (8), suggesting lower severity than SARS and MERS but higher severity than HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. In terms of transmission, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause widespread infection is more reflective of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 than of its more clinically severe relatives. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 cause annual wintertime outbreaks of respiratory illness in temperate regions (9, 10), suggesting that wintertime climate and host behaviors may facilitate transmission, as is true for influenza (11) (12) (13) . Immunity to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 appears to wane appreciably within one year (14), while SARS infection can induce longer-lasting immunity (15). The .

The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. Methods: In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. Results: The value of R 0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58. Conclusions: Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea.\n",

In particular, MERS continues to pose a significant threat in the Middle East since 2012. Currently, no licensed vaccine or drug treatment is available to treat patients infected with either coronavirus. However, there are some MERS vaccines in the preclinical stage of development. We sought to evaluate the potential impact of targeted vaccination strategies for mitigating SARS and MERS outbreaks in healthcare settings using simple mathematical models and detailed historic transmission trees describing the progression of past nosocomial outbreaks of SARS and MERS. Results: Our findings suggest that vaccination strategies targeting patients and healthcare workers, which have been disproportionately affected during past outbreaks, and assuming two vaccination coverage levels at 50 and 75% have the potential to avert nearly 50% or more of MERS or SARS cases. Conclusion: Our modeling results informed by historic outbreak data for SARS and MERS suggest that vaccination strategies targeting patients could be an effective measure to mitigate and prevent outbreaks in the healthcare setting.\n",

Here we provide a head-to-head comparison of exposure patterns and transmission dynamics of large hospital clusters of MERS and SARS, including the most recent South Korean outbreak of MERS in 2015. Methods: To assess the unexpected nature of the recent South Korean nosocomial outbreak of MERS and estimate the probability of future large hospital clusters, we compared exposure and transmission patterns for previously reported hospital clusters of MERS and SARS, based on individual-level data and transmission tree information. We carried out simulations of nosocomial outbreaks of MERS and SARS using branching process models rooted in transmission tree data, and inferred the probability and characteristics of large outbreaks. Results: A significant fraction of MERS cases were linked to the healthcare setting, ranging from 43.5 % for the nosocomial outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2014 to 100 % for both the outbreak in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, in 2013 and the outbreak in South Korea in 2015. Both MERS and SARS nosocomial outbreaks are characterized by early nosocomial super-spreading events, with the reproduction number dropping below 1 within three to five disease generations. There was a systematic difference in the exposure patterns of MERS and SARS: a majority of MERS cases occurred among patients who sought care in the same facilities as the index case, whereas there was a greater concentration of SARS cases among healthcare workers throughout the outbreak. Exposure patterns differed slightly by disease generation, however, especially for SARS. Moreover, the distributions of secondary cases per single primary case varied highly across individual hospital outbreaks (Kruskal-Wallis test; P < 0.0001), with significantly higher transmission heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases for MERS than SARS. Simulations indicate a 2-fold higher probability of occurrence of large outbreaks (>100 cases) for SARS than MERS (2 % versus 1 %); however, owing to higher transmission heterogeneity, the largest outbreaks of MERS are characterized by sharper incidence peaks. The probability of occurrence of MERS outbreaks larger than the South Korean cluster (n = 186) is of the order of 1 %. Our study suggests that the South Korean outbreak followed a similar progression to previously described hospital clusters involving coronaviruses, with early super-spreading events generating a disproportionately large number of secondary infections, and the transmission potential diminishing greatly in subsequent generations. Differences in relative exposure patterns and transmission heterogeneity of MERS and SARS could point to changes in hospital practices since 2003 or differences in transmission mechanisms of these coronaviruses.\n",

      "\t• Bats are hosts to a range of pathogens, some of which are known to infect and cause disease in humans and domestic animals. Human activities that increase exposure to bats will likely increase the opportunity for these infections to spill over from bats to humans in the future. • Understanding the impacts of anthropogenic changes on infection dynamics within bat populations is necessary to predict and prevent human infections of bat origin. However, this initially requires understanding both bat populations and the dynamics of infections within them. • We propose that a combination of field and laboratory studies are needed to create data-driven mathematical models to elucidate aspects of bat ecology that are most critical to the dynamics of emerging bat viruses. Bats are hosts to a range of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic pathogens. Human activities that increase exposure to bats will likely increase the opportunity for infections to spill over in the future. Ecological drivers of pathogen spillover and emergence in novel hosts, including humans, involve a complex mixture of processes, and understanding these complexities may aid in predicting spillover. In particular, only once the pathogen and host ecologies are known can the impacts of anthropogenic changes be fully appreciated. Cross-disciplinary approaches are required to understand how host and pathogen ecology interact. Bats differ from other sylvatic disease reservoirs because of their unique and diverse lifestyles, including their ability to fly, often highly gregarious social structures, long lifespans and low fecundity rates. We highlight how these traits may affect infection dynamics and how both host and pathogen traits may interact to affect infection dynamics. We identify key questions relating to the ecology of infectious diseases in bats and propose that a combination of field and laboratory studies are needed to create data-driven mechanistic models to elucidate those aspects of bat ecology that are most critical to the dynamics of emerging bat viruses. If commonalities can be found, then predicting the dynamics of newly emerging diseases may be possible. This modelling approach will be particularly important in scenarios when population surveillance data are unavailable and when it is unclear which aspects of host ecology are driving infection dynamics.\n",

      "\teast Asia is as a principal hotspot for emerging zoonotic infections. Understanding the likely pathways for their emergence and spread requires knowledge on human-human and human-animal contacts, but such studies are rare. We used self-completed and interviewer-completed contact diaries to quantify patterns of these contacts for 965 individuals in 2017/2018 in a high-income densely-populated area of China, Shanghai City. Interviewer-completed diaries recorded more social contacts (19.3 vs. 18.0) and longer social contact duration (35.0 vs. 29.1 hours) than self-reporting. Strong age-assortativity was observed in all age groups especially among young participants (aged 7-20) and middle aged participants (25-55 years). 17.7% of participants reported touching animals (15.3% (pets), 0.0% (poultry) and 0.1% (livestock)). Human-human contact was very frequent but contact with animals (especially poultry) was rare although associated with frequent human-human contact. Hence, this densely populated area is more likely to act as an accelerator for human-human spread but less likely to be at the source of a zoonosis outbreak. We also propose that telephone interview at the end of reporting day is a potential improvement of the design of future contact surveys. Most of the major global infectious disease threats of the last decade (including epidemics of pandemic influenza A/H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola) have emerged from pathogens crossing the species barrier from animals to humans. A principal hotspot for such disease emergence is the megacities of East Asia 1 . For these diseases, successful establishment in human populations is dictated by both animal-to-human (most notably with domesticated animals raised in agricultural settings such as poultry, swine and cattle) and human-to-human contact 2 . However, studies measuring and characterizing contacts on human-animal interface and subsequent transmission among humans are scarce. For emerging pathogens with established human-human transmission, the spread or even outbreak in humans will be driven by patterns of human encounters, which can also determine the effectiveness of interventions against them (e.g. vaccination, contact tracing and social distancing) 3 . Patterns of human encounters are location specific, therefore improving local intervention strategies relies on understanding local patterns of social contact 4-8 . There are still, however, relatively few empirical studies of age-specific social contacts which integrate location, animal contact data, and the interaction between human-human and human-animal contact. Furthermore, an evaluation of public health strategies that is based on social contact information derived from a different country that might not be representative of local mixing and may result in erroneous conclusions 9 . China is a large, diverse country with rapid economic development, high urbanization, and frequent interaction between humans and animals. The richest and most populous city is Shanghai with a population of 24 million. We used two types of questionnaire delivery (self-completed and telephone interview) to quantify social contact patterns in Shanghai City, which is a hub for spreading infectious diseases due to its high population density and connectivity of the air transportation network.\n",

Transspecies transmission is also common for gammaretroviruses; PERV, for example, is the result of a transspecies transmission from mice to pigs [3, 4] . GaLV and KoRV are also the result of a transspecies transmission of a retrovirus from a still unknown host. Related viruses have been found in rodents and bats and it is of great interest to find the precursor virus and its hosts. To study the transmission of retroviruses from one species to another is of great importance in the context of transmissions, which may occur, for example, when PERVs are transmitted to the human recipients during xenotransplantation.\n",

      "\tTraditionally, the emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) has been attributed to a gain in receptor 2 binding in a new host. Our previous work with SARS-like viruses argued that bats already 3 harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that 4 additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming 5 host restriction of two MERS-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that 6 the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate 7 infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show 8 that the bat virus spike can mediate infection of human gut cells, but is unable to infect human 9 lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike 10 does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike 11 receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues replication of HKU5-CoV, a 13 second MERS-like group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of 14 the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate 16 emergence potential of CoVs and offer a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic 17 CoV strains. 18 Importance Overall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a 20 subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding 21 and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating 22 the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also 23 offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue 24 that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence 25 events in humans.\n",

      "\tWe discovered a lethal hemorrhagic syndrome arising from severe thrombocytopenia in Japanese macaques kept at the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University. Extensive investigation identified that simian retrovirus type 4 (SRV-4) was the causative agent of the disease. SRV-4 had previously been isolated only from cynomolgus macaques in which it is usually asymptomatic. We consider that the SRV-4 crossed the so-called species barrier between cynomolgus and Japanese macaques, leading to extremely severe acute symptoms in the latter. Infectious agents that cross the species barrier occasionally amplify in virulence, which is not observed in the original hosts. In such cases, the new hosts are usually distantly related to the original hosts. However, Japanese macaques are closely related to cynomolgus macaques, and can even hybridize when given the opportunity. This lethal outbreak of a novel pathogen in Japanese macaques highlights the need to modify our expectations about virulence with regards crossing species barriers.\n",

      "\tCoronaviruses (CoVs) have formerly been regarded as relatively harmless respiratory pathogens to humans. However, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as a result of zoonotic CoVs crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations. This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses. For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptors contributing to diverse host affinity in various species. We outline the research still needed to fully elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of these viruses, to construct reproducible animal models, and ultimately develop countermeasures to conquer not only SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but also these emerging coronaviral diseases. [6] provided insight for researchers into the origin of this novel coronavirus. Notably, the SARS pandemic was declared to be over in 2004 when no more infections in patients were being detected. Subsequently, certain SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats demonstrated the ability to infect human cells without prior adaptation [7, 8] which indicates the possibility of the re-emergence of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-like viruses. A decade later in June 2012, another highly pathogenic and novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, was isolated from the sputum of a male patient who died from acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia [9] . Nosocomial infections were reported, and international travel led to the transmission of MERS-CoV to countries outside of the Arabian Peninsula, causing it to become a global pathophoresis. In May 2015, an outbreak of MERS occurred in South Korea due to an individual returning from the Middle East [10] . Based on the lessons learned from managing SARS-CoV prevalence over the last decade, tremendous progress toward unraveling the biological characteristics of MERS-CoV has been achieved at an unprecedented speed. Scientific advancements have allowed for rapid and systemic progress in our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV share several important common features that contribute to nosocomial transmission, preferential viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, and viral immunopathology. This review highlights the epidemiology and pathogenesis of these viruses, including our current understanding of their biological characteristics, their transmission, and their replication in the host. The spike proteins (S proteins) of CoVs play pivotal roles in viral infection and pathogenesis. As critical surface-located trimeric glycoproteins of CoVs, they guide entry into host cells. In this review, we summarize the structure and function of the S proteins and therapeutics designed to target them. Moreover, we will explore how CoV-host interactions cause pathogenic outcomes and discuss potential treatment options, as well as describe recent mammalian models that closely recapitulate the pathogenic process and have contributed to the development of prevention and treatment strategies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Although several potential therapies have been identified with SARS and MERS in animal and in vitro models, human clinical trials remain lacking, hindering the advancement of these potential countermeasures.

      "\tBats are reservoir hosts of several high-impact viruses that cause significant human diseases, including Nipah virus, Marburg virus and rabies virus. They also harbor many other viruses that are thought to have caused disease in humans after spillover into intermediate hosts, including SARS and MERS coronaviruses. As is usual with reservoir hosts, these viruses apparently cause little or no pathology in bats. Despite the importance of bats as reservoir hosts of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic agents, virtually nothing is known about the host/virus relationships; principally because few colonies of bats are available for experimental infections, a lack of reagents, methods and expertise for studying bat antiviral responses and immunology, and the difficulty of conducting meaningful field work. These challenges can be addressed, in part, with new technologies that are species-independent that can provide insight into the interactions of bats and viruses, which should clarify how the viruses persist in nature, and what risk factors might facilitate transmission to humans and livestock.\n",

Dromedary camels are the primary zoonotic reservoir for human infections. Interruption of the zoonotic transmission chain from camels to humans, therefore, may be an effective strategy to control the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak. Here we show that vaccination with an adjuvanted MERS-CoV Spike protein subunit vaccine confers complete protection from MERS-CoV disease in alpaca and results in reduced and delayed viral shedding in the upper airways of dromedary camels. Protection in alpaca correlates with high serum neutralizing antibody titers. Lower titers of serum neutralizing antibodies correlate with delayed and significantly reduced shedding in the nasal turbinates of dromedary camels. Together, these data indicate that induction of robust neutralizing humoral immune responses by vaccination of naïve animals reduces shedding that potentially could diminish the risk of zoonotic transmission. and virus isolation [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Serologic studies suggest that MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for at least three decades in regions as wide ranging as the Middle East, North Africa, and East Africa [16] . The outbreak among human populations has persisted-albeit in low numbers-despite a lack of sustained human-to-human transmission [17, 18] . Data from molecular epidemiologic studies suggest that the outbreak has endured through multiple zoonotic spillover events from dromedary camels to humans. Additionally, several studies in Saudi Arabia and Qatar have demonstrated a clear epidemiologic link between camel and human populations [4, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Although MERS-CoV typically causes severe pneumonia in humans, the virus primarily infects the upper respiratory tract of dromedary camels, from where viable virus is shed in high quantities for approximately 7 days, and where viral RNA can be detected up to 35 days [27] . Occupational exposure that involves close proximity to infected dromedary camels is a major risk factor for human acquisition. This risk profile has been confirmed by studies in Saudi Arabia where camel herders and slaughterhouse workers were much more likely than the general population to either have serologic evidence of past exposure to 26] . The high case fatality rate, continued zoonotic transmission, and sustained animal reservoir of MERS-CoV underscore the need for intervention strategies focused on preventing zoonotic transmission. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of an intramuscular, adjuvanted S1 subunit vaccine to prevent infection or reduce shedding in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) and alpaca (Vicugna pacos).

      "\tKnowledge of human behaviors is important for improving indoor-environment design, building-energy efficiency, and productivity, and for studies of infection spread. However, such data are lacking. In this study, we designed a device for detecting and recording, second by second, the 3D indoor positioning and head and body motions of each graduate student in an office. From more than 400 person hours of data. Students spent 92.2%, 4.1%, 2.9%, and 0.8% of their time in their own office cubicles, other office cubicles, aisles, and areas near public facilities, respectively. They spent 9.7% of time in close contact, and each student averagely had 4.0 close contacts/h. Students spent long time on close contact in the office which may lead to high infection risk. The average interpersonal distance during close contact was 0.81 m. When sitting, students preferred small relative face orientation angle. Pairs of standing students preferred a face-to-face orientation during close contact which means this pattern had a lower infection risk via close contact. Probability of close contact decreased exponentially with the increasing distance between two students' cubicles. Data on human behaviour during close contact is helpful for infection risk analysis and infection control and prevention. 2 of 18 deposition, for example, droplets deposited on trousers on the thighs of a sitting person should be more than on a standing person. Very little data exist on indoor close contact behaviors, especially data combining all of the factors mentioned above. Some human behaviors are difficult to accurately monitor with high temporal resolution [11, 19] . Electronic sensors such as radiofrequency identification devices (RFIDs) are the most commonly used to collect human contact data. These devices, however, can only detect close contact by taking readings of interpersonal distance every 20 s, and only one-on-one close contact can be detected [23, 24] . A temporal resolution of 20 s is not sufficient, as the median value duration of a close contact is 17 s [11] . Moreover, human respiratory activities and movement of body parts (e.g., head and body) cannot be detected by this means. Body movements impact the air flows in a room. To collect close contact data with high temporal resolution, video recordings have been used, which can be processed second-by-second [11, 19] . This approach is subject to human error on the part of the video analysts, and also time-consuming. Office are the most common form of workplace for the most of employees, with open-plan designs widely used [25, 26] . In this study, we monitored and analyzed indoor human behaviors in a graduate student office using automatic devices installed on the hats and clothes of the participants. These devices overcome nearly all of the shortcomings mentioned above and automatically collect high-resolution data on indoor human behaviors. The data monitored included the indoor position, head and body motion, and posture of each individual which are important for infectious disease transmission. We collected more than 1,440,000 s of data for 49 students across two days. This study supported data of indoor human behaviors on close contact. From indoor positioning distribution, we can know that which part in the office has higher infection risk. Combining individual inhalation and exhalation patterns with head's and body's motion during close contact, high-precision quantitative risk assessment on infection spread and control could be conducted. The experiments were conducted in two close-by Chinese graduate student offices on two consecutive Saturdays. The choice of two nearly identical offices was due to the need of minimising microbial interference, as the experiment also contained another part on surface microbial monitoring, which is not reported in this paper. Each room was designed for a maximum of 30 students, i.e., containing 30 cubicles (Figure 1 ). There were 26 students (13 male and 13 female) in Room 1 on the first experiment day (day 1), and 23 students (12 male and 11 female) in Room 2 on the second experiment day (day 2). A total of 32 students participated in the experiment, and 17 of them in both experiments. Among 32 participants, 27 students were those who worked in the institute and five students were invited by some students who were in the institute. In addition, three pairs of students were romantically involved. We selected these students because they were familiar with the experimental environment, which should minimize any bias caused by environment. The length (12.2 m) and height (2.73 m) of both rooms were the same, and the layouts of the cubicles in the two rooms were symmetrical, see Figure 1 . Each room had a water dispenser and a group of lockers. Only Room 2 had a printer. Each room was divided into six cubicle regions (marked by dotted lines in Figure 1 ), and students in the same cubicle region were more likely to communicate with each other. All of the students were monitored by 22 video cameras (1080P) from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. The indoor temperature during the experimental days, which controlled by central air conditionings, was between 26 and 27 degrees. There were 27 fluorescent tubes on the ceiling of the office to keep the luminance, therefore, combing with the high-resolution cameras, most human behaviors can be captured. Each camera monitored one or two office cubicles, except for two with a global view, one camera for the door, and one camera for the water dispenser.\n",

      "\tAirborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public health challenges. A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207-222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm 2 of 222-nm light inactivating >95% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus. Continuous very low dose-rate far-UVC light in indoor public locations is a promising, safe and inexpensive tool to reduce the spread of airbornemediated microbial diseases. Airborne-mediated microbial diseases represent one of the major challenges to worldwide public health 1 . Common examples are influenza 2 , appearing in seasonal 3 and pandemic 4 forms, and bacterially-based airborne-mediated diseases such as tuberculosis 5 , increasingly emerging in multi-drug resistant form. A direct approach to prevent the transmission of airborne-mediated disease is inactivation of the corresponding airborne pathogens, and in fact the airborne antimicrobial efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) light has long been established 6-8 . Germicidal UV light can also efficiently inactivate both drug-sensitive and multi-drug-resistant bacteria 9 , as well as differing strains of viruses 10 . However, the widespread use of germicidal ultraviolet light in public settings has been very limited because conventional UVC light sources are a human health hazard, being both carcinogenic and cataractogenic 11,12 . By contrast, we have earlier shown that far-UVC light generated by filtered excimer lamps emitting in the 207 to 222 nm wavelength range, efficiently inactivates drug-resistant bacteria, without apparent harm to exposed mammalian skin [13] [14] [15] . The biophysical reason is that, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light does not have sufficient range to penetrate through even the outer layer (stratum corneum) on the surface of human skin, nor the outer tear layer on the outer surface of the eye, neither of which contain living cells; however, because bacteria and viruses are typically of micron or smaller dimensions, far-UVC light can still efficiently traverse and inactivate them [13] [14] [15] . The earlier studies on the germicidal efficacy of far UVC light 13,15-18 were performed exposing bacteria irradiated on a surface or in suspension. In that a major pathway for the spread of influenza A is aerosol transmission 3 , we investigate for the first time the efficacy of far-UVC 222-nm light for inactivating airborne viruses carried by aerosols -with the goal of providing a potentially safe alternative to conventional 254-nm germicidal lamps to inactivate airborne microbes.

      "\tMask ventilation and coughing during oro-tracheal suctioning produce aerosols that enhance nosocomial transmission of respiratory infections. We examined the extent of exhaled air dispersion from a human-patient-simulator during mask ventilation by different groups of healthcare workers and coughing bouts. The simulator was programmed to mimic varying severity of lung injury. Exhaled airflow was marked with tiny smoke particles, and highlighted by laser light-sheet. We determined the normalized exhaled air concentration in the leakage jet plume from the light scattered by smoke particles. Smoke concentration ≥20% was considered as significant exposure. Exhaled air leaked from mask-face interface in the transverse plane was most severe (267 ± 44 mm) with Ambu silicone resuscitator performed by nurses. Dispersion was however similar among anesthesiologists/ intensivists, respiratory physicians and medical students using Ambu or Laerdal silicone resuscitator, p = 0.974. The largest dispersion was 860 ± 93 mm during normal coughing effort without tracheal intubation and decreased with worsening coughing efforts. Oro-tracheal suctioning reduced dispersion significantly, p < 0.001, and was more effective when applied continuously. Skills to ensure good fit during mask ventilation are important in preventing air leakage through the mask-face interface. Continuous oro-tracheal suctioning minimized exhaled air dispersion during coughing bouts when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Respiratory failure is a serious complication of emerging infectious respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 1,2 , avian influenza 3 , influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection 4 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 5 . Supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and occasionally invasive mechanical ventilation are required for managing these patients 1-5 . During the major outbreak of SARS, it was found that procedures related to tracheal intubation 6 , oxygen administration ≥6 L/min, and NIV were independent risk factors for super-spreading nosocomial outbreaks affecting many healthcare workers in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China 7 . In a systematic review of aerosol generating procedures that might increase the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS to healthcare workers, mask ventilation and oro-tracheal suctioning increased the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals, CI) to 2.8 (1.3-6.4) and 6.2 (2.2-18.1), respectively 8 . In this respect, we have previously shown that the dispersion distances of exhaled plume along the sagittal and transverse planes were 200 and 220 mm, respectively, when bag-mask ventilation was attempted in a human-patient-simulator (HPS) 9 . Although the addition of a viral-bacterial filter eliminated forward leakage of exhaled air from the expiration diverter, leakage at the interface between the mask and the patient's face was increased to 340 mm along the transverse plane. It is unclear if the increased leakage along the transverse plane was due to the higher resistance with the filter or related to inefficient mask seal 9 . In addition, oro-tracheal suctioning may trigger coughing bouts that could further increase the spread of potentially infectious droplets. However, effective suction may limit the dispersion. Further studies are therefore required to examine if there are technical or human factors involved that\n",

      "\tInfluenza A viruses result in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide each year. In this study, influenza A transmission in a graduate student office is simulated via long-range airborne, fomite, and close contact routes based on real data from more than 3500 person-to-person contacts and 127,000 surface touches obtained by video-camera. The long-range airborne, fomite and close contact routes contribute to 54.3%, 4.2% and 44.5% of influenza A infections, respectively. For the fomite route, 59.8%, 38.1% and 2.1% of viruses are transmitted to the hands of students from private surfaces around the infected students, the students themselves and other susceptible students, respectively. The intranasal dose via fomites of the students' bodies, belongings, computers, desks, chairs and public facilities are 8.0%, 6.8%, 13.2%, 57.8%, 9.3% and 4.9%, respectively. The intranasal dose does not monotonously increase or decrease with the virus transfer rate between hands and surfaces. Mask wearing is much more useful than hand washing for control of influenza A in the tested office setting. Regular cleaning of high-touch surfaces, which can reduce the infection risk by 2.14%, is recommended and is much more efficient than hand-washing. via airplane and other modes of public transport [15] . Microscopic factors such as how people talk or make contact with each other are ignored because of complexity. Most human behaviour, including person-to-person contact and surface touches, are hypothesised even when all transmission routes are considered. However, human behaviour changes with the environment, and large errors may result if all human behaviour is unknown or randomly set. A simulation of influenza A transmission based on realistic data of human behaviour in a confined space is needed to help understand influenza A transmission and to implement effective measures to prevent and control disease. In this study, we simulated influenza A transmission in a graduate student office by considering three routes: long-range airborne, fomite and close contact (short-range airborne and droplet spray). All student behaviour, including close contact and surface touches in the office, was recorded by video-camera from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., from 11 to 15 September 2017. The data included more than 3500 close contacts between students and more than 127,000 surface touches. Influenza A transmission was simulated in the office via three routes based on realistic behaviour obtained from these recorded data. We discovered how influenza A virus is transmitted via air, hands, surfaces, mucous membranes and inhalation. We also analysed the efficacy of various strategies for prevention of influenza A via various transmission routes.\n",

      "\tThe dynamics and significance of aerosol transmission of respiratory viruses are still controversial, for the major reasons that virus aerosols are inefficiently collected by commonly used air samplers and that the collected viruses are inactivated by the collection method. Without knowledge of virus viability, infection risk analyses lack accuracy. This pilot study was performed to (i) determine whether infectious (viable) respiratory viruses in aerosols could be collected from air in a real world environment by the viable virus aerosol sampler (VIVAS), (ii) compare and contrast the efficacy of the standard bioaerosol sampler, the BioSampler, with that of the VIVAS for the collection of airborne viruses in a real world environment, and (iii) gain insights for the use of the VIVAS for respiratory virus sampling. The VIVAS operates via a water vapor condensation process to enlarge aerosolized virus particles to facilitate their capture. A variety of viable human respiratory viruses, including influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and influenza B viruses, were collected by the VIVAS located at least 2 m from seated patients, during a late-onset 2016 influenza virus outbreak. Whereas the BioSampler when operated following our optimized parameters also collected virus aerosols, it was nevertheless overall less successful based on a lower frequency of virus isolation in most cases. This side-by-side comparison highlights some limitations of past studies based on impingement-based sampling, which may have generated false-negative results due to either poor collection efficiency and/or virus inactivation due to the collection process. IMPORTANCE The significance of virus aerosols in the natural transmission of respiratory diseases has been a contentious issue, primarily because it is difficult to collect or sample virus aerosols using currently available air sampling devices. We tested a new air sampler based on water vapor condensation for efficient sampling of viable airborne respiratory viruses in a student health care center as a model of a real world environment. The new sampler outperformed the industry standard device (the SKC BioSampler) in the collection of natural virus aerosols and in maintaining virus viability. These results using the VIVAS indicate that respiratory virus aerosols are more prevalent and potentially pose a greater inhalation biohazard than previously thought. The VIVAS thus appears to be a useful apparatus for microbiology air quality tests related to the detection of viable airborne viruses.\n",

      "\tBackground: Avian H5N1 influenza viruses present a challenge in the laboratory environment, as they are difficult to collect from the air due to their small size and relatively low concentration. In an effort to generate effective methods of H5N1 air removal and ensure the safety of laboratory personnel, this study was designed to investigate the characteristics of aerosolized H5N1 produced by laboratory manipulations during research studies. Results: Normal laboratory procedures used to process the influenza virus were carried out independently and the amount of virus polluting the on-site atmosphere was measured. In particular, zootomy, grinding, centrifugation, pipetting, magnetic stirring, egg inoculation, and experimental zoogenetic infection were performed. In addition, common accidents associated with each process were simulated, including breaking glass containers, syringe injection of influenza virus solution, and rupturing of centrifuge tubes. A micro-cluster sampling ambient air pollution collection device was used to collect air samples. The collected viruses were tested for activity by measuring their ability to induce hemagglutination with chicken red blood cells and to propagate in chicken embryos after direct inoculation, the latter being detected by reverse-transcription PCR and HA test. The results showed that the air samples from the normal centrifugal group and the negative-control group were negative, while all other groups were positive for H5N1. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there are numerous sources of aerosols in laboratory operations involving H5N1. Thus, laboratory personnel should be aware of the exposure risk that accompanies routine procedures involved in H5N1 processing and take proactive measures to prevent accidental infection and decrease the risk of virus aerosol leakage beyond the laboratory.\n",

Therefore, the importance of the airborne route in a clinical context is difficult to determine. The aim of this study was to design a chamber system to study the airborne transmission of viruses between ferrets. Methods: A system composed of three chambers connected in series, each one housing one ferret and preventing direct contact, was designed. The chambers were designed to house the ferrets for several days and to study the transmission of viruses from an infected (index) ferret to two naïve ferrets via aerosols and droplets or aerosols only. A particle separator was designed that can be used to modulate the size of the particles traveling between the chambers. The chamber system was validated using standard dust as well as with ferrets infected with influenza A virus. Conclusions: The 50% efficiency cut-off of the separator could be modulated between a 5-µm and an 8-µm aerodynamic diameter. In the described setup, influenza A virus was transmitted through the aerosol route in two out of three experiments, and through aerosols and droplets in all three experiments.\n",

These 27 domes only form after heavy rains that are rare in the Chihuahuan desert. CCB is a unique oasis 28 with hundreds of ponds, containing endemic species of animals, plants and highly diverse and 29 unique microbial communities, despite its very biased stoichiometry, due mostly to extreme low 30 phosphorus content (soils, water columns and sediments). This extreme oligotrophy has favored 31 survival of ancestral microorganisms. Whole metagenome sequencing approach was performed for 32 this unusual site in three different seasons to assess the extent of the Archaea biodiversity, with a 33 focus on extremophiles, since members of the Archaea had been underrepresented in different study 34 sites within the oasis. We found a highly diverse Archaea community compassing ~5% of the 35 metagenomes.

CCB biodiversity is believed to have evolved as a 71 result of a long time environmental stability of a deep aquifer [29], as suggested by the marine 72 affiliations in many of the studied bacterial genomes [25, 30], virus [31], and probably, Archaea. 73 These observations led CCB scientists to raise hypothesis and propose CCB as a model of \"lost 74 world\", where extreme conditions favored the survival of ancestral marine lineages that in some 75 cases persist exclusively in this area [32]. Nevertheless, Archaea in CCB has been poorly studied 76 since they were underrepresented in previous metagenomic studies [24, 28, 33, 34]. 77 During a late March 2016 field work, an atypical spring rain apparently dissolved the salty 78 crust of an unnoticed shallow pond, allowing the uniquely flexible and impermeable microbial mats 79 to arise from the ground building bubbles, or domes with a strong sulfur-like smell.

However, the contagious COVID-19 novel virus need to be studied urgently, especially how to contain the spreading in our community. Drawing a sample of 345 Vietnamese citizens from 15 to 47 years old, we found that the risk perception is the main factor which drives the behaviors in wearing medical masks in the public. This substantially contributes to the behavioral economics as well as infectious disease epidemiology to understand and creating behavior change to cope with this deadly virus. In addition, age is also a factor should be carefully examined later because we found that the elder is likely to wear masks after the COVID-19 outbreaks, with the weak evidence. Finally, those who have good habit in wearing mask are consistent to their behaviors. Based on our results, we would suggest two main policies at that time. The communication about the COVID-19 risk is very important to drive the human behaviors.

Cholera vaccines not only provide health benefits to susceptible populations but also have effects on the earning capabilities and financial stability of the family. Community-based research and evaluations are necessary to understand perceptions about and practices of the community relating to cholera and oral cholera vaccines. This may help identify the ways in which such vaccines may be successfully introduced, and other preventive measures can be implemented. The present study assessed the knowledge of, attitudes toward, and preventive practices relating to cholera and oral cholera vaccine among an urban population residing in a high cholera-prone setting in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in an area of high cholera prevalence in 15 randomly-selected clusters in Mirpur, Dhaka city. A study team collected data through a survey and in-depth interviews during Results: Of 2,830 families included in the final analysis, 23% could recognize cholera as acute watery diarrhea and 16% had ever heard of oral cholera vaccine. About 54% of the respondents had poor knowledge about cholerarelated issues while 97% had a positive attitude toward cholera and oral cholera vaccine. One-third showed poor practice relating to the prevention of cholera. The findings showed a significant (p < 0.05) association between the respondents' knowledge and sex, education, occupation, monthly overall household expenditure, attitudes and practice. In the adjusted model, male sex, having a lower monthly overall household expenditure, and having a less positive attitude toward cholera were the significant predictors to having poor knowledge. Conclusions: The findings suggest the strengthening of health education activities to improve knowledge on cholera, its prevention and treatment and information on cholera vaccination among high-risk populations. The data also underscore the potential of mass cholera vaccination to prevent and control cholera.\n",

The aim of this study was to gain insight into the experiences of volunteers from the European Union who worked in deployable laboratories in West Africa during the outbreak. This study is part of the EMERGE project. We assessed the experiences of 251 volunteers with a 19-item online questionnaire. The questions asked about positive aspects of volunteering such as learning new skills, establishing a new path in life, and changing life values. Other questionnaire subjects were the compliance to follow-up measures, the extent to which volunteers felt these measures restricted their daily activities, the fear of stigmatization, and worries about becoming infected or infecting their families. The volunteers reported positive effects that reached far beyond their daily work, such as changes in life priorities and a greater appreciation of the value of their own lives. Although the volunteers did not feel that temperature monitoring restricted their daily activities, full compliance to temperature monitoring and reporting it to the authorities was low. The volunteers did not fear Ebola infection for themselves or their families and were not afraid of stigmatization. With respect to the burden on the families, 50% reported that their family members were worried that the volunteer would be infected with Ebola virus. Altogether, the positive experiences of the volunteers in this study far outweigh the negative implications and constitute an important argument for inspiring people who intend to join such missions and for motivating the hesitant ones.\n",

Environmental hygiene in the wet market has established a link between the presence of rodents with probability of leptospirosis infection. This study was aimed to compare the level of knowledge, attitude and preventive practice against leptospirosis between healthy Malaysian and non-Malaysian wet market workers in selected wet markets in urban areas of Selangor. A cross-sectional study in the determined area was conducted with the participation of 147 respondents. The respondents were randomly chosen from the list provided by the state agency that regulates these markets. A self-administered bilingual validated questionnaire (English and Bahasa Melayu) was distributed to the selected respondents. There were 68 (48.3%) Malaysian respondents and 79 (53.7%) non-Malaysian respondents. The majority of them were males, who attained formal education and were less than 40 years old. Meanwhile, the respondents earned less than RM3000. Among the Malaysian respondents, 80.9% were aware of leptospirosis as compared to 17.7% of the non-Malaysian colleagues (p < 0.05). All items of knowledge showed that the Malaysian respondents scored higher as compared to non-Malaysian respondents. On attitude towards infection prevention, most Malaysian respondents had a positive attitude, while most non-Malaysian respondents had undecided perception on the majority of crucial attitude items. In practicing preventive measures, there was a marked significant difference in proportion between Malaysian and non-Malaysian respondents for items on \"Specific Protection and Isolation at Source.\" There was a significant gap on knowledge, attitude and preventive practice among Malaysian workers as compared to non-Malaysian workers. Therefore, it was highly recommended the health promotion implementation should also provide specific focus on non-Malaysian workers.\n",

Our results demonstrated that seasonal reproduction is characterized by substantial changes of the microbiota and shedding patterns, which are mainly driven by sex, age and reproductive condition of female bats. This study illustrates the complexity of host-microbiota-infection interactions in a significant group of mammals, which are also considered as important hosts of human pathogens with seasonal dynamics (e.g. Marburg and Hendra viruses). Our findings thus provide interesting evidence as to how pathogens may shift seasonally due to lifehistory events that may alter the microbiota and immune system of their hosts, which in turn could have important public health consequences.

The viruses pose a threat of emergence of a global pandemic influenza through point mutation or reassortment leading to a strain that can effectively transmit among humans. In this study, we present phylogenetic evidences for the interlineage reassortment among H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans, cats, and birds in Indonesia, and identify the potential genetic parents of the reassorted genome segments. Parsimony analyses of viral phylogeography suggest that the reassortant viruses may have originated from greater Jakarta and surroundings, and subsequently spread to other regions in the West Java province. In addition, Bayesian methods were used to elucidate the genetic diversity dynamics of the reassortant strain and one of its genetic parents, which revealed a more rapid initial growth of genetic diversity in the reassortant viruses relative to their genetic parent. These results demonstrate that interlineage exchange of genetic information may play a pivotal role in determining viral genetic diversity in a focal population. Moreover, our study also revealed significantly stronger diversifying selection on the M1 and PB2 genes in the lineages preceding and subsequent to the emergence of the reassortant viruses, respectively. We discuss how the corresponding mutations might drive the adaptation and onward transmission of the newly formed reassortant viruses.\n",

      "\tBackground: Chickens are susceptible to infection with a limited number of Influenza A viruses and are a potential source of a human influenza pandemic. In particular, H5 and H7 haemagglutinin subtypes can evolve from low to highly pathogenic strains in gallinaceous poultry. Ducks on the other hand are a natural reservoir for these viruses and are able to withstand most avian influenza strains. Results: Transcriptomic sequencing of lung and ileum tissue samples from birds infected with high (H5N1) and low (H5N2) pathogenic influenza viruses has allowed us to compare the early host response to these infections in both these species. Chickens (but not ducks) lack the intracellular receptor for viral ssRNA, RIG-I and the gene for an important RIG-I binding protein, RNF135. These differences in gene content partly explain the differences in host responses to low pathogenic and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in chicken and ducks. We reveal very different patterns of expression of members of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) gene family in ducks and chickens. In ducks, IFITM1, 2 and 3 are strongly up regulated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza, where little response is seen in chickens. Clustering of gene expression profiles suggests IFITM1 and 2 have an anti-viral response and IFITM3 may restrict avian influenza virus through cell membrane fusion. We also show, through molecular phylogenetic analyses, that avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 genes have been subject to both episodic and pervasive positive selection at specific codons. In particular, avian IFITM1 showed evidence of positive selection in the duck lineage at sites known to restrict influenza virus infection. Conclusions: Taken together these results support a model where the IFITM123 protein family and RIG-I all play a crucial role in the tolerance of ducks to highly pathogenic and low pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses when compared to the chicken.\n",

      "\tPrecise dating of viral subtype divergence enables researchers to correlate divergence with geographic and demographic occurrences. When historical data are absent (that is, the overwhelming majority), viral sequence sampling on a time scale commensurate with the rate of substitution permits the inference of the times of subtype divergence. Currently, researchers use two strategies to approach this task, both requiring strong conditions on the molecular clock assumption of substitution rate. As the underlying structure of the substitution rate process at the time of subtype divergence is not understood and likely highly variable, we present a simple method that estimates rates of substitution, and from there, times of divergence, without use of an assumed molecular clock. We accomplish this by blending estimates of the substitution rate for triplets of dated sequences where each sequence draws from a distinct viral subtype, providing a zerothorder approximation for the rate between subtypes. As an example, we calculate the time of divergence for three genes among influenza subtypes A-H3N2 and B using subtype C as an outgroup. We show a time of divergence approximately 100 years ago, substantially more recent than previous estimates which range from 250 to 3800 years ago.\n",

Effective influenza surveillance requires new methods capable of rapid and inexpensive genomic analysis of evolving viral species for pandemic preparedness, to understand the evolution of circulating viral species, and for vaccine strain selection. We have developed one such approach based on previously described broad-range reverse transcription PCR/ electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) technology. Methods and Principal Findings. Analysis of base compositions of RT-PCR amplicons from influenza core gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, M, NS, NP) are used to provide subspecies identification and infer influenza virus H and N subtypes. Using this approach, we detected and correctly identified 92 mammalian and avian influenza isolates, representing 30 different H and N types, including 29 avian H5N1 isolates. Further, direct analysis of 656 human clinical respiratory specimens collected over a seven-year period (1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006) showed correct identification of the viral species and subtypes with .97% sensitivity and specificity. Base composition derived clusters inferred from this analysis showed 100% concordance to previously established clades. Ongoing surveillance of samples from the recent influenza virus seasons (2005)(2006) showed evidence for emergence and establishment of new genotypes of circulating H3N2 strains worldwide. Mixed viral quasispecies were found in approximately 1% of these recent samples providing a view into viral evolution. Conclusion/Significance. Thus, rapid RT-PCR/ESI-MS analysis can be used to simultaneously identify all species of influenza viruses with clade-level resolution, identify mixed viral populations and monitor global spread and emergence of novel viral genotypes. This high-throughput method promises to become an integral component of influenza surveillance.\n",

FUBAR analysis shows that the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and nucleocapsid proteins. From these results, 2019nCoV could be considered a coronavirus distinct from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it the ability to infect humans. author/funder.

This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARSlike bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans.

The variability in alleles at those sites can be translated into prediction probabilities that a particular pathogen isolate is adapted to a given host. We illustrate the power of these methods by: 1) identifying the sites explaining SARS coronavirus differences between human, bat and palm civet samples; 2) showing how cross species jumps of rabies virus among bat populations can be readily identified; and 3) de novo identification of likely functional influenza host discriminant markers.\n",

A sequence-independent virus discovery technique (VIDISCA) was used in combination with high throughput sequencing to detect two novel parvoviruses: a PARV4-like virus named Eh-BtPV-1 in Eidolon helvum from Ghana and the first member of a putative new genus in Artibeus jamaicensis from Panama (Aj-BtPV-1). Those viruses were circulating in the corresponding bat colony at rates of 7-8%. Aj-BtPV-1 was also found in Artibeus lituratus (5.5%). Both viruses were detected in the blood of infected animals at high concentrations: up to 10E8 and to 10E10 copies/ml for Aj-BtPV-1 and Eh-BtPV-1 respectively. Eh-BtPV-1 was additionally detected in all organs collected from bats (brain, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and intestine) and spleen and kidneys were identified as the most likely sites where viral replication takes place. Our study shows that bat parvoviruses share common ancestors with known parvoviruses of humans and livestock.

Characterization of AlsPV by whole-genome sequencing and analyzing antigenic relatedness revealed it is a rubulavirus that is closely related to parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5). Intranasal exposure of mice to AlsPV resulted in no clinical signs of disease, although viral RNA was detected in the olfactory bulbs of two mice at 21 days post exposure. Oronasal challenge of ferrets resulted in subclinical upper respiratory tract infection, viral shedding in respiratory secretions, and detection of viral antigen in the olfactory bulb of the brain. These results imply that AlsPV may be similar to PIV5 in its ability to infect multiple mammalian host species.

Such an introduction through travelling led to the emergence of a MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea in May 2015, which caused more than 140 confirmed human cases in less than a month. Using 70 complete genome sequences of MERS-CoV isolates, including the most recent sequences for the Korean and Chinese isolates, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the complete genome and the individual protein coding regions. The Korean MERS-CoV strain clustered in the previously established Hafr-Al-Batin-1_2013 clade together with two Saudi Arabian and one Chinese strain sampled in 2015. Although these four strains remained monophyletic in the entire protein-coding region, this clade showed different phylogenetic relationships across the genome, indicating a shared unique recombination pattern that is different from previously reported putative recombination strains.

A limited number of studies have investigated the prevalence of enteric pathogens in Cameroon, and as in many other African countries, the cause of many diarrheal episodes remains unexplained. A proportion of these unknown cases of diarrhea are likely caused by yet-unidentified viral agents, some of which could be the result of (recent) interspecies transmission from animal reservoirs, like bats. Using viral metagenomics, we screened fecal samples of 221 humans (almost all with gastroenteritis symptoms) between 0 and 89 years of age with different degrees of bat contact. We identified viruses belonging to families that are known to cause gastroenteritis such as Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae. Interestingly, a mammalian orthoreovirus, picobirnaviruses, a smacovirus, and a pecovirus were also found. Although there was no evidence of interspecies transmission of the most common human gastroenteritis-related viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, and Reoviridae), the phylogenies of the identified orthoreovirus, picobirnavirus, and smacovirus indicate a genetic relatedness of these viruses identified in stools of humans and those of bats and/or other animals. These findings points out the possibility of interspecies transmission or simply a shared host of these viruses (bacterial, fungal, parasitic, . . .) present in both animals (bats) and humans. Further screening of bat viruses in humans or vice versa will elucidate the epidemiological potential threats of animal viruses to human health. Furthermore, this study showed a huge diversity of highly divergent novel phages, thereby expanding the existing phageome considerably.\n",

      "\tThe novel alpaca coronavirus described here was isolated during an outbreak of severe respiratory disease and associated abortions in alpaca in 2007, following co-mingling of a large number of animals at a national exposition and sale [1] . Subsequent large outbreaks of the disease have not been reported, leaving questions remaining as to the origins of the outbreak virus, as well the persistence of ACoV in the national alpaca population. Similarities between the whole genome sequences of ACoV and HCoV-229E, a coronavirus first isolated around 1960, [27, 28] are evident. Though speculative, the similarities suggest a transmission event between humans and alpacas. Molecular studies suggest the possibility that HCoV-229E was acquired by humans from a host switching event a few hundred years ago and most likely involved bats [29] . Therefore, it is not surprising to find bat CoV isolated from Hipposideros bat species so closely grouped with the HCoV-229E and ACoV viruses in the phylogenetic analysis of the nucleocapsid gene. Although it is possible that the speculative transmission event between humans and camelids was recent, the evolutionary ancestor appears more closely related to HCoV-229E viruses isolated around 1960, and ACoVs may more realistically have been circulating for decades at low levels in alpaca populations. New world camelids were introduced into the U.S. as recently as 1985, meaning associated health management and diagnostic medicine practices are still relatively new. It is not unreasonable to assume that ACoV could have caused respiratory disease in individual animals and herds, without accurate diagnosis for decades. In the United States, alpacas are generally maintained in small herds where exposure to new infectious agents would occur primarily when unrelated naive and actively shedding animals are co-mingled. This occurred prior during the 2007 outbreak and helps to explain the large number of severely affected animals at a single point in time. Most Alphacoronaviruses, including AcoV, utilize Aminopeptidase N of their natural host as a receptor, and host tropism differences of viruses are caused by the ability of their spike proteins to detect small species-specific amino acid differences in the aminopeptidase N [8, 13] . Despite the host specificity of this receptor, all of those viruses are known to bind and utilize feline Aminopeptidase N, suggestive of a common coronavirus ancestor infecting feline species [30] . This would explain the ability to grow ACoV on feline origin cell lines, such as Crandell-feline kidney cells (CRFK) [31] , and the failure to propagate virus on numerous other mammalian cell lines [1] . Due to the severe clinical signs associated with ACoV, the Camelid industry has expressed interest in the use of vaccination as a possible disease control option. The question was raised if a potential use of the bovine coronavirus vaccine might protect camelid species from the respiratory ACoV. Evaluating the sequence data due to potential binding mechanism of the ACoV as a Alphacoronavirus shows a completely different pattern compared to the enteric alpaca coronavirus and the bovine coronavirus, both belonging in the Betacoronavirus group. Betacoronaviruses are known for using mostly sialic acid binding activity for viral entry [32] , whereas alphacoronaviruses can utilize Aminopeptidase N binding as a mechanism. Based on genome sequencing information, it is presumed that vaccines targeting Betacoronaviruses will likely not prevent infection with Alphacoronaviruses, such as AcoV, due to the different cell entry mechanism. The spike gene has the critical role of virus entry and membrane fusion processes in the host cell, however, work with chimeric viruses also shows the spike protein can influence tropism and pathogenesis of certain coronaviruses [33] [34] [35] . It is interesting to note that the spike genes, which tend to contain hypervariable regions, for the ACoV and HCoV-229E are more similar to each other than the nucleocapsid genes. Evolutionary studies monitoring HCoV-229E found only limited variation within the S gene nucleotide sequences in contrast to the evolutionary pattern of spike genes in other human coronaviruses [36, 37] , suggesting the spike protein is evolutionarily stabile. Nucleocapsid sequence comparisons among feline coronavirus isolates suggest the mutation patterns can be associated with geographic origin, rather than with virulence patterns [38] . It would be interesting to compare nucleocapsid sequence of South American HCoV-229E strains to the ACoV nucleocapsid strain. The ACoV described in this sequence analysis has several unique characteristics. The virus has a truncated or disrupted ORF 4a/4b, which has been reported for other, but not all HCoV-229E isolates [39] . Whether this ORF truncation is real or a laboratory artifact (in vitro growth in cell culture) remains to be elucidated. Also, as compared to HCoV-229E, the ACoV has an extra putative ORF \"X\" overlapping the 3' end of the nucleocapsid gene. Further laboratory experiments will be required to determine if this gene is expressed and, if so, the protein's in vivo function. It is critical to characterize and understand new and emerging viruses, particularly in the context of zoonosis, whether transmitted from animal to man or man to animal. Coronaviruses, considered the most frequent source of the common cold in humans, are also widely dispersed throughout mammalian and avian populations. They have shown an ability to jump species, resulting in mild to serious zoonotic disease threats. The current ACoV genomic data provides strong evidence of an evolutionary relationship between HCoV-229E and AcoV. Whether the virus represents a recent cross-species transmission or a more distant transmission between humans and alpacas is yet to be determined. It would be interesting to analyze South American HCoV-229E isolates that were obtained in different years to determine the genetic similarities to the ACoV. This line of investigation might shed more light on the possibility of human to alpaca or alpaca to human transmission events and help to calculate when such an event might have occurred.\n",

      "\tBackground: As of March 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 80174 people and caused 2915 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42·9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.\n",

While all individuals were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and viral shedding to the 15 environment varied considerably. Many commonly used items, toilet facilities, and air samples had evidence of viral contamination, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is shed to the environment as expired particles, during toileting, and through contact with fomites.

      "\tThe ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied. Methods: Thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration. The ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow. Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n",

The study involved 38 individuals who were infected directly and indirectly with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), by a super-spreader patient. Tracer gas experiments conducted on the eighth floor, where the initial patient was hospitalized, confirmed that the tracer gas spread to adjacent patient rooms and rooms across corridors. In particular, the experiment with an external wind direction and speed similar to those during the hospitalization of the initial patient revealed that the air change rate was 17-20 air changes per hour (ACH), with air introduced through the window in the room of the infected patient (room 8104). The tracer gas concentration of room 8110, which was the farthest room, was 7.56% of room 8104, indicating that a high concentration of gas has spread from room 8104 to rooms across the corridor. In contrast, the tracer gas was barely detected in a maternity ward to the south of room 8104, where there was no secondary infected patient. Moreover, MERS is known to spread mainly by droplets through close contact, but long-distance dispersion is probable in certain environments, such as that of a super-spreader patient hospitalized in a room without ventilation, hospitals with a central corridor type, and indoor airflow dispersion due to external wind.\n",

      "\tMask ventilation and coughing during oro-tracheal suctioning produce aerosols that enhance nosocomial transmission of respiratory infections. We examined the extent of exhaled air dispersion from a human-patient-simulator during mask ventilation by different groups of healthcare workers and coughing bouts. The simulator was programmed to mimic varying severity of lung injury. Exhaled airflow was marked with tiny smoke particles, and highlighted by laser light-sheet. We determined the normalized exhaled air concentration in the leakage jet plume from the light scattered by smoke particles. Smoke concentration ≥20% was considered as significant exposure. Exhaled air leaked from mask-face interface in the transverse plane was most severe (267 ± 44 mm) with Ambu silicone resuscitator performed by nurses. Dispersion was however similar among anesthesiologists/ intensivists, respiratory physicians and medical students using Ambu or Laerdal silicone resuscitator, p = 0.974. The largest dispersion was 860 ± 93 mm during normal coughing effort without tracheal intubation and decreased with worsening coughing efforts. Oro-tracheal suctioning reduced dispersion significantly, p < 0.001, and was more effective when applied continuously. Skills to ensure good fit during mask ventilation are important in preventing air leakage through the mask-face interface. Continuous oro-tracheal suctioning minimized exhaled air dispersion during coughing bouts when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Respiratory failure is a serious complication of emerging infectious respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 1,2 , avian influenza 3 , influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection 4 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 5 . Supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and occasionally invasive mechanical ventilation are required for managing these patients 1-5 . During the major outbreak of SARS, it was found that procedures related to tracheal intubation 6 , oxygen administration ≥6 L/min, and NIV were independent risk factors for super-spreading nosocomial outbreaks affecting many healthcare workers in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China 7 . In a systematic review of aerosol generating procedures that might increase the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS to healthcare workers, mask ventilation and oro-tracheal suctioning increased the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals, CI) to 2.8 (1.3-6.4) and 6.2 (2.2-18.1), respectively 8 . In this respect, we have previously shown that the dispersion distances of exhaled plume along the sagittal and transverse planes were 200 and 220 mm, respectively, when bag-mask ventilation was attempted in a human-patient-simulator (HPS) 9 . Although the addition of a viral-bacterial filter eliminated forward leakage of exhaled air from the expiration diverter, leakage at the interface between the mask and the patient's face was increased to 340 mm along the transverse plane. It is unclear if the increased leakage along the transverse plane was due to the higher resistance with the filter or related to inefficient mask seal 9 . In addition, oro-tracheal suctioning may trigger coughing bouts that could further increase the spread of potentially infectious droplets. However, effective suction may limit the dispersion. Further studies are therefore required to examine if there are technical or human factors involved that\n",

      "\tInfluenza A viruses result in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide each year. In this study, influenza A transmission in a graduate student office is simulated via long-range airborne, fomite, and close contact routes based on real data from more than 3500 person-to-person contacts and 127,000 surface touches obtained by video-camera. The long-range airborne, fomite and close contact routes contribute to 54.3%, 4.2% and 44.5% of influenza A infections, respectively. For the fomite route, 59.8%, 38.1% and 2.1% of viruses are transmitted to the hands of students from private surfaces around the infected students, the students themselves and other susceptible students, respectively. The intranasal dose via fomites of the students' bodies, belongings, computers, desks, chairs and public facilities are 8.0%, 6.8%, 13.2%, 57.8%, 9.3% and 4.9%, respectively. The intranasal dose does not monotonously increase or decrease with the virus transfer rate between hands and surfaces. Mask wearing is much more useful than hand washing for control of influenza A in the tested office setting. Regular cleaning of high-touch surfaces, which can reduce the infection risk by 2.14%, is recommended and is much more efficient than hand-washing. via airplane and other modes of public transport [15] . Microscopic factors such as how people talk or make contact with each other are ignored because of complexity. Most human behaviour, including person-to-person contact and surface touches, are hypothesised even when all transmission routes are considered. However, human behaviour changes with the environment, and large errors may result if all human behaviour is unknown or randomly set. A simulation of influenza A transmission based on realistic data of human behaviour in a confined space is needed to help understand influenza A transmission and to implement effective measures to prevent and control disease. In this study, we simulated influenza A transmission in a graduate student office by considering three routes: long-range airborne, fomite and close contact (short-range airborne and droplet spray). All student behaviour, including close contact and surface touches in the office, was recorded by video-camera from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., from 11 to 15 September 2017. The data included more than 3500 close contacts between students and more than 127,000 surface touches. Influenza A transmission was simulated in the office via three routes based on realistic behaviour obtained from these recorded data. We discovered how influenza A virus is transmitted via air, hands, surfaces, mucous membranes and inhalation. We also analysed the efficacy of various strategies for prevention of influenza A via various transmission routes.\n",

We then analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections. Results: Eight topics emerged overall: clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. It was observed that COVID-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization, epidemiological study, and virus transmission at present. In contrast, topics about diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, genomics and pathogenesis only accounted for less than 10% or even 4% of all the COVID-19 publications, much lower than those of other CoV infections.

      "\tTo truly elucidate the role of bats as reservoirs for arboviruses, field surveillance studies documenting natural infection and transmission dynamics among vector and vertebrate species must be supplemented with experimental infections to characterize viremia profiles and infectiousness to vectors, virus-induced pathology, and immune kinetics following infection. With bats, these tasks are not trivial, and carry significant challenges in both the field and the lab. These challenges are evidenced by the few arboviruses for which there are substantial field and laboratory data involving the infection of bats. While many studies have presented serologic data indicative of past exposure of free-ranging bats to arboviruses of medical and veterinary importance, these studies should be followed up with laboratory assessments of reservoir host competence to shed light on the true epidemiological significance of the field data. Further, the detection of viral nucleic acid in free-ranging bats does not necessarily implicate the species as an arboviral reservoir. Rather, recovery and isolation of live virus at biologically relevant titers, and demonstrating the persistence of the pathogen in nature among connected populations of a potential reservoir species is more definitive. Unfortunately, few established bat colonies exist for use in vivo viral pathogenesis studies, limiting the achievability of these studies. To fulfill the vertebrate reservoir host paradigm, in vivo infections must support findings in the field. The isolation of Marburg virus from Egyptian rousette bats in Uganda in addition to experimental infections demonstrating viremia and shedding in the absence of overt pathology support the role of this bat species as the reservoir for Marburg virus [6, 7, 208] . For arboviruses, the combination of field work and in vivo pathogenesis studies are lacking. Still, several examples have emerged from this review that point to bats as potentially competent amplifying hosts for arboviruses. Kaeng Khoi virus was isolated from both bats and cimicid bugs in Thailand, and was also shown to be the causative agent behind sick mine workers [21] . Some bat species did develop a viremia at a level that would be infectious to mosquitoes when inoculated experimentally with CHIKV, and bats have been found exposed to CHIKV during field investigations [66, 143] . Experimental evidence supporting transmission of RRV from Pteropus poliocephalus to recipient mosquitoes in addition to identification of RRV-seropositive bats trapped in Australia and Indonesia highlights the need for further investigation into the role of bats in the ecology of this disease [75, 149, 157] . A mosquito-bat-mosquito transmission cycle was established in the lab for JBEV [67] . Serological evidence from the field documenting bat exposure to JBEV, the sustained viremia in bats during hibernation, and demonstration of mosquito transmission from and to bats in the laboratory collectively demonstrate the capability of bats to function as reservoir hosts for this virus. Circumstantial evidence from field-sampled mosquitoes and bats supports the cycling of Babanki virus among bats and mosquitoes in Uganda [29] , but experimental data are still lacking. For RVFV, bats evaluated in the lab have supported virus replication, and multiple populations of bats in the field have been found with neutralizing antibodies or natural infection with RVFV [1, 28, 29] . Additional studies are warranted on these and other viruses for which additional field or experimental data are needed to support the role of bats as a possible reservoir.

How camels came to carry the virus they live with today remains unknown, but it is academic for the control of MERS. To date, human-to-human transmission has been inefficient, but virus surveillance and characterisation will ensure any change to the status quo is identified. MERS-CoV is not currently a pandemic threat; it is spread with the aid of human habit and error. Nevertheless, a much needed therapeutic toolbox is being developed, and in this process we are learning more about how CoVs cause disease, how they confound our immune responses, where they come from, and how to prevent and treat their respiratory infections [90] . Focused research is needed to minimise the impact of MERS, basing control strategies on evidence gleaned from specifically addressing relevant unknowns.\n",

      "\tDespite the progress in our understanding of MERS-CoV, many questions remain unanswered. The definitive origin, exact mechanism of transmission, and the reason behind seasonal variability are still unclear. Although most cases have been described in countries of the Arabian Peninsula, the increasing travel to the region and the Hajj season in KSA pose a threat of a potential global pandemic. Extensive efforts are required to speed up the development of an effective therapy and vaccine. Repurposing of currently available pharmaceutical agents is highly desirable for a more rapid drug development. Meanwhile, HCWs who encounter patients with respiratory symptoms who have lived or traveled to areas with MERS-CoV should have a low threshold to consider a diagnosis of MERS-CoV, with testing and immediate implementation of proper infection control practices to prevent further spread. Finally, given the important role that camels may play in transmission of the virus, the common practices in the Arabian Peninsula of herding and consuming unpasteurized camels' milk should be discouraged until conclusive evidence is obtained that such practices do not contribute to infection.\n",

      "\tKazakhstan and the United States have partnered since 2003 to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The US Department of Defense (US DoD) has funded threat reduction programs to eliminate biological weapons, secure material in repositories that could be targeted for theft, and enhance surveillance systems to monitor infectious disease outbreaks that would affect national security. The cooperative biological research (CBR) program of the US DoD's Biological Threat Reduction Program has provided financing, mentorship, infrastructure, and biologic research support to Kazakhstani scientists and research institutes since 2005. The objective of this paper is to provide a historical perspective for the CBR involvement in Kazakhstan, including project chronology, successes and challenges to allow lessons learned to be applied to future CBR endeavors. A project compendium from open source data and interviews with partner country Kazakhstani participants, project collaborators, and stakeholders was developed utilizing studies from 2004 to the present. An earlier project map was used as a basis to determine project linkages and continuations during the evolution of the CBR program. It was determined that consistent and effective networking increases the chances to collaborate especially for competitive funding opportunities. Overall, the CBR program has increased scientific capabilities in Kazakhstan while reducing their risk of biological threats. However, there is still need for increased scientific transparency and an overall strategy to develop a capability-based model to better enhance and sustain future research. Finally, we offer a living perspective that can be applied to further link related studies especially those related to One Health and zoonoses and the assessment of similar capability-building programs.

Thus, meteorological information should be integrated into future forecast of potential outbreak of new SARS. The identification of bats as very likely natural hosts for SARS-CoVs and consideration of some other wild animals as potential intermediate hosts leads to a prevention requirement of protecting natural ecosystem and prohibiting consumption of wildlife. The presentation of different scenarios of SARS outbreaks points to some urgency in identifying the true origin(s) of SARS-CoVs and establishing more comprehensive anti-infection measures that will resist any kind of viral assault.

      "\tCurrently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for 2019 novel coronavirus disease . In this study, ten severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65×10 9 /L vs. 0.76×10 9 /L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesionswithin 7 days. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was welltolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials. COVID-19is currently a big threat to global health. However, no specific antiviral agents are available for its treatment. In this work, we explored the feasibility of convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue severe patients. The results from 10 severe adult cases showed that one dose (200 mL) of CP was welltolerated and could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing antibodies at a high level, leading to disappearance of viremia in 7 days.

      "\tThe recent discovery of H7N9 virus infections by a new influenza virus strain in three critically ill patients, as reported by Gao et al. [8, 10] , is of major public health significance. Laboratory testing conducted in China showed that H7N9 viruses were sensitive to anti-influenza drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors. These drugs were effective against seasonal influenza and H5N1 virus infections when given early in the course of the illness. However, these drugs had not yet been used to treat H7N9 infections. To date, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of P. R. China has released two editions of the influenza A H7N9 clinic programs in which supporting therapies including oxygen therapy, antipyretic therapy, and cough and phlegm relief and medicinal therapy with antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir and zanamivir were recommended. Particularly, respiratory support including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was recommended for critically ill patients. TCM therapy was also recommended as a second-line treatment for H7N9 infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that TCMs may have beneficial effects on patients with avian influenza [11, 12] . Our univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the duration of TCM therapy could be partially associated with the prognosis in H7N9-infected patients. However, TCM therapy was not considered for four critically ill patients with ARDS, which might have accounted for the short duration of TCM therapy in the critically ill group. Consequently, the therapeutic value of TCM therapy in critically ill patients might have been underestimated. Further studies including randomized controlled trials are needed to fully evaluate TCM therapy in this patient population. Nine patients were also treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). Six of the nine patients recovered, one was in severe condition, and two died. Examination of baseline characteristics of H7N9-infected patients revealed that most patients were elderly males, suggesting that elderly people were at higher risk for H7N9 infection. In contrast, a high proportion of severe cases and deaths in H5N1 infection occurred in children [13] . The high proportion of elderly patients in H7N9 infection might be attributed to higher exposure of the elderly to H7N9 virus or to age-related body functions, such as decreased immune function [14] . Although H7N9 infections preferentially occurred in males, our logistic regression analysis did not show any statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes between genders. Our results suggested that history of smoking and/or underlying clinical conditions may increase risk for infection, especially for patients with hypertension, diabetes, and heart-pulmonary insufficiency. Four patients, including three from group A and one from group B, had a smoking history of 30 to 40 years with 20 to 40 cigarette smoking per day, which could have contributed to their poor respiratory function. Nearly half of the patients (8/18) had hypertension, two had diabetes, three had coronary heart diseases, and three had COPD, indicating that chronic heart and lung diseases would increase risk for H7N9 infection. Poultry and wild birds have been recognized as natural reservoir of IAVs [15] . In our study, only three patients had confirmed exposure to poultry or wild birds 7 d before onset of illness. However, according to previous report, 60% of H7N9-infected patients in China had epidemiological links to poultry and/or wild birds [16] . Li et al. also reported that 77% of H7N9-infected patients in their study had a history of exposure to live animals, including chicken (76%) [17] . Taken together, avoiding contact with poultry and wild birds may effectively reduce the risk of infection. Meanwhile, placing infected poultry and wild birds in quarantine is important for the control and prevention of H7N9 infection. Our results also suggested that early diagnosis and treatment of H7N9 infection were critical in achieving favorable clinical outcomes. In our study, nearly all H7N9-infected patients were treated as common pneumonia in the early stage of the illness. The average time from onset of symptoms to H7N9 virus confirmation was 7.162.03 days in group A and 6.3862.07 days in group B. Antiviral treatment was not initiated until 5-6 days after the onset of illness. The delayed diagnosis and treatment for this highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection might have partially contributed to the poor prognosis in H7N9-infected patients. We believe that early surveillance and early diagnosis are of great importance for favorable clinical outcome. Full characterization of clinical features of H7N9 infection should speed up diagnosis and treatment. Most H7N9-infected patients in our study had developed severe conditions with one or more complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, renal failure, septic shock, encephalopathy, and secondary infections. Our results suggested that such complications significantly worsened the clinical outcomes of H7N9-infected patients. Effective management of complications in the course of the disease would be critical to achieve favorable clinical outcomes and prevention of death. Our results showed that H7N9-infected patients in critical conditions had higher C-reactive protein level and more severe renal insufficiency and myocardium injury. C-reactive protein level might be used as an early marker for clinical prognosis in H7N9 patients based on results from our logistic regression analyses, which was in agreement with previous studies showing that C-reactive protein level might serve as a marker for severity of illness in influenza infections [18, 19] . Since multivariate analysis was not performed in our small sample study, further research is needed to verify this. Interestingly, levels of T cell subsets including total CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD45 + T cells, were all lower in patients in critical conditions than those in recovered conditions. The protective role of CD8 + T cells in AIV infections has been discussed in previous studies [20, 21] . It has been shown that CD8 + T cell-mediated responses in patients were mainly directed against conserved viral proteins, enabling CD8 + T cells to provide protection against heterologous influenza strains [22] . CD4 + T cells have also been reported to contribute to immunity against influenza. Previous studies showed that CD4 + T cells were induced after influenza virus infection and played a central role in acquired immunity through induction and maintenance of CD8 + memory T cells and assisting B cells in antibody production [23, 24] . CD45 + T cells were found to be not only essential for efficient T-and Bcell antigen receptor signal transduction but also involved in cytokine signaling [25, 26] . CD45KO mice and humans who lacked CD45 expression were severely immunodeficient and had very few peripheral T lymphocytes with impaired T and B cell responses [27] [28] [29] . Results of our analysis suggested that T cellmediated responses might play an important role in immune defense against H7N9 virus infection. Further studies on T cellmediated responses during H7N9 infection might provide useful information to help develop effective therapies such as H7N9 vaccines. We used glucocorticoid therapy for most H7N9-infected patients in our observational study. Some controversies exist in the use of glucocorticoid therapy for IAV infection. Han et al. reported that early use of parenteral glucocorticoid therapy for fever reduction and pneumonia prevention in patients with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection increased the risk of critical disease and death [30] . Likewise, He et al. advised that glucocorticoids should not be used in critically ill patients with H1N1 influenza infection [31] . However, Carter argued that while steroids should not be used as monotherapy in the treatment of avian influenza, they might provide therapeutic benefits as an adjunct therapy to antiviral agents if prescribed at appropriate dosages [32] . We found no clear association between glucocorticoid therapy and clinical outcomes in H7N9-infected patients in our study. Future studies with larger patient populations are required to evaluate the benefits and risks asscocaited with glucocorticoid therapy in treatment of H7N9 infections. In conclusion, successful treatment of H7N9 influenza depends on early diagnosis of H7N9 infection at the onset of clinical symptoms even if they are mild. Knowledge of risk factors, clinical features, and potential complications discussed in our paper would help clinicians who triage patients with suspected or confirmed H7N9 infection determine appropriate treatment strategies and fight potential epidemic/pandemic. Increased research and surveillance are required to further understand the pathogenesis of H7N9 infection and epidemiological factors that contribute to severe conditions. Further studies are also needed to identify H7N9 natural reservoirs and delineate mechanisms of transmission. The preliminary results reported in the present article were from a small sample study. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to verify and extend our findings.\n",

      "\tPatients with recurrent meningitis were younger, with less immunosuppression conditions and had a better survival versus those with non-recurrent meningitis. Mortality of PM was associated with immunosuppression and impaired consciousness, but the small number of deaths in the recurrent group did not allow us to analyses the differences between the two groups. The disease is very contagious and was considered a childhood infection but now it has been identified also in adults. Consent Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this Case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor of this journal. Background Primo-infection with varicella zoster virus causes varicella, one of the most frequent pathologies in the first stage of childhood and not only. The complications of this disease may vary from pyogenic infections to pneumonia and neurological (cerebellar) lesions. Within the last years in medical practice other complications of extreme gravity of varicella emerged: cellulitis, compartment syndrome, sepsis of various etiologies (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Gram negative germs, etc.) Performant modern apparel certainly contributes to establishing the bacteriologic diagnosis and implicitly the antibiogram which led to an optimal therapeutical behavior. From experience, we consider that the varicella zoster virus is more virulent, being able to cause severe forms or complication in certain patients categories. Consent Written informed consent was obtained from the parents for publication of this Case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor of this journal. In our study the prevalence of anaerobic PJI was 5.3 %, a prevalence similar to the one cited in the literature but this prevalence may be higher. Anaerobic bacteria are slow growing organisms and they require special conditions to grow, thus the number of false negative results can be significant. Background Streptococcus pneumoniae, along with Neisseria meningitidis, represent two of the most frequent causes of bacterial meningitis in adolescents and young adults. Delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment of this condition may result in serious complications such as brain damage, hearing loss or even death. Case report We present the case of a 37 year old female, without any known medical condition, under no current medication, who was admitted in our clinic for fever, chills, fronto-occipital headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, symptoms which had been present for the last 36 hours with progressive enhancement. Upon physical examination she was febrile (38.3°C), sweating, no pulmonary crackles or cardiac murmurs, her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and pulse rate was 74 bpm, without hepatosplenomegaly, oriented to time and place but with signs of meningeal irritation (Kernig's sign, Brudzinski's sign, and nuchal rigidity). Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, biological inflammatory syndrome, electrolyte imbalance, positive procalcitonin, negative HIV, HTLV serology, negative markers of viral hepatitis B or C, normal urinalysis, negative hemocultures, and sinus X-ray showed bilateral maxillary sinusitis. Lumbar puncture at the moment showed no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) modification: normal pressure, clear appearance, negative Pandy's reaction, 1 cell/μL, protein -31 mg/dL, glucose -57 mg/dL, chloride -700 mg/dL, negative CSF cultures. PCR using mass spectrometry (PLEX -ID) performed from CSF identified Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast showed minimal meningeal enhancement, with no other modifications. Given all this data (clinical appearance and identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae in CSF using PLEX-ID), we considered the case as bacterial meningitis at an early stage, with normal CSF. She received treatment with meropenem 2 g q8h, vancomycin 1 g q12h and dexamethasone for 14 days with very good clinical response. The lumbar puncture repeated after 10 days showed no change from the previous examination. The patient fully recovered with no sequelae. Conclusions Bacterial meningitis exhibiting apparently normal CSF parameters, even if uncommon, is a very well-recognized phenomenon. A lumbar puncture which shows no abnormalities in CSF cannot exclude bacterial meningitis in the early stage of the disease. Empiric antibiotic should be used when the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is strongly suspected even in the cases with normal CSF results. PCR technique represents a great tool in establishing the causative pathogen of meningitis, making possible the diagnosis of this condition even in the early stages when no changes in the CSF are noticeable. Mycoplasma pneumoniae should be considered in all cases with fever and respiratory symptoms evolving unfavorably treated with betalactamine and associates MEP. Background In children, bacterial sepsis is a not a very common condition but it is often accompanied by severe complications that can leave sequelae. Sometimes it can be life-threatening and requires a complex and quickly set treatment. Sepsis is more common in immunosuppressed patients. Streptococcus suis could be miss-identified as other species of streptococci, thus in the settings that lack resources to routinely speciate α-hemolytic streptococci and where (undercooked) pork is a basic diet, underdiagnosis of Streptococcus suis infection is likely. Hearing loss, although is not a complication related to Streptococcus suis meningitis, is frequently reported. The percentage of KP strains isolated from blood increased between 2010 and 2015. We didn't find statistically significant changes of the resistance rates of KP to all the classes of tested antimicrobials. The presence of carbapenem resistance among the isolates from 2015 could be a major problem for the public health and hospital-acquired infections control. Our data regarding the proportion of resistant bloodstream KP strains are different from those reported by EARS-Net. We found lower and decreasing resistance rates to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, third generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and combined resistance. Still, with Romania occupying one of the first places in Europe regarding KP isolated from invasive infections resistance to antibiotics, further monitoring is mandatory and efforts should be made in order to control this problem. Background Staphylococcus aureus has a high incidence in human infectious pathology, registering severe infections caused by antibiotic-resistant strains. In Romania, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounts to up to 53.8 % of S. aureus strains isolated from blood cultures (EARS-Net report 2012). In many European countries, the percentage of MRSA invasive infections caused by S. aureus decreased below 25 % through the implementation of programs designed to limit bacterial resistance. Objectives: to determine the antibiotics resistance of S. aureus strains isolated from blood cultures. This study showed that bla CTX-M are the most prevalent resistance genes in ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Quebec City and are part of groups 1 and 9. This is consistent with global data showing the predominance of the CTX-M ESBL worldwide and with recent epidemiological data, in other regions in Canada, showing that CTX-M-15 as well as CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-9, being respectively part of groups 1 and 9, are most commonly found. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental trial conducted in Romania with combined therapy antibiotics and bacteriophages since 1975, which proved the safety of bacteriophages in clinical settings. We consider this study the cornerstone for future research regarding in vivo phage therapy in Romania. Oxacillin resistance incidence in Staphylococcus aureus has registered a slight decrease, since 2011, from 55.7 % to 44.8 % in 2015. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are significantly more resistant than Staphylococcus aureus. In 2012 the firsts strains of Enterococcus faecium resistant to vancomycin were isolated and in 2014 their proportion reached 35.0 %. Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance is highly needed, in particular to guide an efficient empirical therapy. Healthcare-associated meningitis or ventriculitis remains challenging in terms of diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Background In a medical world in which infections are caused by bacteria with increased virulence, nosocomial infection is a serious threat for all medical departments. Epidemiological data must be thoroughly collected and interpreted in the setting of clinical facts, thus guiding the complex process of therapeutic intervention. Most of the patients admitted to our clinic over a period of 6 months were infected with multi-resistant bacteria at the time of admission thus emphasizing the spread of germs with high antibiotic resistance in the community and the necessity of a thorough bacteriological survey at the time of inter-hospital transfer. Nosocomial infections remain a constant threat whose dynamics must be closely monitored in the future. The use of directly acting antiviral agents in chronic HCV hepatitis has proved to be efficient and safe in clinical trials. Methods Transaminases, bilirubin, blood cell count at initiation, 2, 4, 8, 12 weeks of treatment were evaluated in 124 patients with HCV associated cirrhosis, undergoing treatment with dasabuvir (Exviera™), ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir (Viekirax™) and ribavirin. HVC-RNA was determined at initiation and at end of therapy (EOT). Therapy with Exviera™/Viekirax™/ribavirin is well tolerated, safe and efficient in patients with chronic HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis. Ribavirin dose reductions should not be a milestone in therapy. Background At the Clinical Hospital for Infectious Diseases, a study has been performed to evaluate antiviral and hepatoprotective effects of the medicinal product Viusid in treatment of viral hepatitis B and C. The treatment of both patient groups with Viusid showed that the clinical and biochemical improvement that was more apparent in Group I, which indicates the protective effect of the medicinal product Viusid; the reduction of HBV DNA level by 50 % and HCV RNA level by 40 %, denotes an antiviral effect of the drug. Hyperbilirubinemia in patients with compensated cirrhosis treated with OPrD-ribavirin regimen represents a severe side effect. Ribavirin must be discontinued in this situation and sometimes all DAA regimen has to be withdrawn. The most important risk factors for this side effect are: Child-Pugh score at baseline 6 and platelet count at baseline below 100000/cmm. The OPrD-Riba regimen was highly efficient in difficult to treat patients with compensated cirrhosis. All the patients that have completed the therapy achieved undetectable viral load and furthermore, in the case of those who completed the 12 weeks period of follow-up, SVR 12 was achieved. The efficacy of OPrD regimen in patients with HCV compensated cirrhosis is similar with or without ribavirin. Because sometimes the ribavirin side effects can conduct to a prematurely discontinuation of all antiviral regimen, we thought that in difficult to treat patients, the regimen without ribavirin could be a better option. Liver decompensation in patients with Child Pugh score A during OPrD-ribavirin regimen has a low rate of probability, but this situation is possible. The diagnosis of compensated cirrhosis probably has to take into account more clinical and biological parameters, not only the ones used by Child Pugh score. The most important side effect was anemia which was correlated with ribavirin use and for some cases ribavirin discontinuation was necessary. Jaundice was another side effect more difficult to control. Complete therapy discontinuations due to adverse events were infrequent. The fibrosis cannot be always correctly determined by FibroMax; it is important to use other alternative test for an accurate diagnosis of cirrhosis. Moreover, even the tests manufacturer from BioPredictive recommends that a fibrotest score with a value more than 0.60 can be interpreted as severe fibrosis and must be treated urgently. The most frequent hematological side effect during OPrD-riba therapy for HCV hepatitis was anemia with recovery after adjusting the ribavirin dosage. Sometimes, the discontinuation of ribavirin was necessary, without impact in efficacy of this regimen. In terms of platelet count a significant improvement was shown. The prevalence of risk factors, behaviors and knowledge on HBV and HCV infection varies in different areas of the world. We have performed a study to determine whether classical risk factors for HBV or HCV showed diversity due to different ethnic or geographic origins in two matched young cohorts: a heterogeneous study group of international medical students, and a control group from the general Romanian population. The worldwide prevalence of certain risk factors for HBV and HCV infection is a serious issue that transcends nationality, gender, ethnic origin or educational level. Our results suggest that a global strategy for prevention and control of hepatitis infection is needed, along with effective vaccination programs. Background Data on hepatitis C virus reactivation (HCV-R) in patients with hematological malignancies (HM) under immunosuppressive therapy are limited. The prevalence of HCV infection is higher in Romania than in other EU countries. We aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics and outcome of HCV-R in patients with HM undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. One third of our patients had HCV-R. HCV can cause fulminant hepatic failure in patients with HM. Close monitoring of HCV-RNA every 3 months should be performed. Although the overall prevalence of risk factors in the general population in Romania appears to be low or under-declared, we have identified certain high-risk groups, which cumulate a large number of risk factors and have high likelihood of acquiring HBV, HCV or HIV infection. We propose priority targeting of these special population groups though information campaigns and risk reduction interventions. Case report A 42 yo patient recently hospitalized in the Râmnicu Vâlcea Hospital for jaundice with immunoglobulin M antibodies against hepatitis A detected in blood is hospitalized in our institute for supervision and the continuation of the treatment. Recent medical history shows the onset of the symptoms 11 days before with fever, jaundice and the patient recognizes contact with a person with confirmed infection with hepatitis A. As a development of the disease, the patient became comatose (GCS 3), with severe respiratory acidosis, depending on advanced respiratory support. After 24 hours, he becomes conscious, but shows limp quadriplegia, facial asymmetry, thenar and hypothenar eminence atrophy, abolished tendinous reflexes and preserved sensitivity. The MRI reveals no alterations that could explain the neurological deficit, the lumbar puncture is within normal limits. The patient had a favorable biological trend with the correction of coagulation disorders and improvement of sepsis markers. The second lumbar puncture showed albuminocytologic dissociation. The findings of motor nerve conduction studies showed markedly reduced amplitudes of compound muscle action potentials and suggested demyelinating polyneuropathy. Based on Guillain-Barré syndrome diagnosis, there were conducted five sessions of plasma exchange and after each of them we noticed progressive improvement of the motor deficit, including of the respiratory muscles, therefore the respiratory support was ceased after 8 days. Acute hepatitis with HAV can also trigger an immune response, therefore clinicians should consider this rare but serious possibility of Guillain-Barré syndrome following acute hepatitis A infection. Based on our results, we would recommend earlier therapy for chronic HCV infection, to ensure faster decrease of liver stiffness after treatment. Further long-term studies are needed to determine the exact pace at which liver fibrosis decreases past the point of SVR. It is estimated that about 103 million people around the world are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Due to population screening for HCV and initiation of antiviral treatment, HCV prevalence decreased in some countries. The purpose of antiviral treatment is to eradicate HCV completely and obtain sustained virologic response (SVR). The bibliographical data confirms that over 99% of patients with SVR remain HCV RNA negative 4-5 years after stopping treatment [1] . Our study shows a high rate of SVR after treatment with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir in naive as well as pre-treated patients with chronic HCV, and no significant side effects from taking these drugs. Background Thrombophilias are a group of hereditary or acquired hematological conditions which predispose to thrombotic phenomena and are triggered by molecular dysfunctions of the hemostasis proteins. The thrombophilia comorbidity in HIV-positive pregnant women has been little studied. No correlation between the incidence of thrombophilia and HIV infection stage or the duration of ARV therapy has been found. An early diagnosis, associated with specific therapy and rigorous monitoring of clinical and biological data, can contribute to a favorable evolution in patients with HIV-HBV coinfection and acute liver failure. The superposition of PML clinical and pathological diagnoses was 3/5 (60 %) and there were no pathologically confirmed cases of HIVE, with elevated levels of over-and under-diagnosis. Thus, the observed lack of correlation calls into better understanding of both illnesses. In the extended presentation we provided an up to date diagnosis algorithm for both. The majority of pregnant women with HIV-consumers of drugs (especially \"new drugs\") have little access to antenatal care, which leads to late discovery of HIV. The use of synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones by HIV pregnant women has important effects on newborns and their subsequent development which poses a challenge for the post-partum surveillance system. These women come from poor families who don't ensure them a proper support. Furthermore, due to issues associated to risky behavior it is difficult to include them in HIV screening or prevention programmes, which need to be adapted to their needs.  There is some evidence that the tests used: APRI and FIB-4 have the ability to distinguish for both groups of patients (HIV and HIV/HBV) between the two classes of fibrosis (F0-1 to F ≥ 2), patients with and without advanced liver disease. Although in patients with HIV infection a low concordance was seen between non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of fibrosis, in co-infected patients it was moderate and these tests could be used as evaluation methods in their monitoring of liver injury especially when the results of these tests are concordant. The positive correlation between the serum level of LL37 and IFN ɣ or LL37 and ALT suggests a possible implication of this peptide in liver injury in HCV patients. Further studies are needed to translate the results from in vitro studies on LL37 into the clinical practice. Modern molecular biology techniques (GeneExpert) offer the possibility of early pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis and subsequent treatment in patients with HIV/AIDS. However, the advanced immunosuppression, together with non-compliance to treatment may associate an unfavorable evolution. There is a high risk behavior and HIV prevalence among IDUs. Thus there is a need for rapid introduction of interventions to address this problem. The authors consider that gangliosides expressed on the membrane of the HIV-infected cells might induce the synthesis of antiganglioside antibodies. The presence of anti-ganglioside antibodies seems to be a primary immunological event in HIV infection and might play a physiopathological role in the studied viral infection. The ability of the host to produce an early antigangliosidic response might be seen as a defense mechanism directed to the elimination of a danger signal. Background Since its discovery in 1983, HIV-1 has become the most extensively studied pathogen in history. Antiretroviral therapy has markedly improved the quality and the lifespan of people living with HIV. Despite achieving viral suppression many of the HIV infected patients may still harbor persistent low levels of inflammation that may contribute to premature aging and cardiovascular comorbidities. Our objective was to evaluate subclinical chronic inflammation in a cohort of persons living with HIV who were undergoing ART, based on persistent viral replication. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study in a cohort of Caucasian HIV-1 patients attending the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof. Dr. Matei Balș\", Bucharest, Romania. All included patients were under ART for at least 6 months. Blood samples were tested for: HIV viral load, CD4 cells count, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in all patients. We evaluated inflammatory markers comparatively between two groups: undetectable patients (with HIV viral loads below the level of detectiongroup 1) and HIV patients with persistent replication (group 2). Independent samples T-test and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test were used for assessing statistical differences between groups. Results Sixty patients with a mean age of 33.2 (±13.7 years) were included in the study -60 % were males. The mean time on ART was 80 (±47.8 months). Most patients (71.7 %) had serum HIV loads below the limit of detection (group 1). Mean CD4 counts were 522 (±272.9 cells/cmm) for the entire cohort and 565.4 (±268.3 cells/cmm) in group 1 and 414.2 (±261.2 cells/cmm) in group 2. Median CRP values were 1.79 (IQR = 4.6) mg/L in group 1, compared to 2.57 (IQR = 7.6) mg/L in patients with detectable viremia (without statistical significance, p = 0.92). Mean IL-6 values were 37.2 (±60.7) pg/mL for group 1 vs 66 (±15.5) pg/mL in group 2 (with the level of statistical significance close to the cut-off value, p = 0.06). TNF-alpha mean values were 20 (±14.4) pg/mL in detectable patients (group 2) compared to 16.6 (±17.5) pg/mL in group 2 (p = 0.48). In our cohort undergoing ART we noted similar levels of CRP and TNF-alpha for patients with persistent viral replication and undetectable viremia. The levels of IL-6 seemed to be higher in the group with detectable viremia. Background Guillain-Barré syndrome, is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy triggered by an acute infectious process. Etiopathogenetically, the condition usually follows a viral infection (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Varicella-Zoster, herpes). We present a case of acute polyradiculoneuritis, manifested by a pathological picture installed in the evolution of acute varicella (Guillain-Barré syndrome) to an immunocompetent patient. Biological rigorous clinical monitoring, along with an effective interdisciplinary collaboration in chickenpox cases with neurological complications may favorably influence the evolution of the patients. Early diagnosis of herpetic encephalitis along with specific antiviral therapy can favorably influence the evolution of the disease in immunocompetent adults with this brain disorder known with a high potential of severity.

Background Measles represent a problem in current infectious pathologies through the possibility of appearance of severe forms of measles and/or some types of patients. The absence of vaccination due to various reasons leads to spread of this disease in the receptive population and the evolution of infections (center) or small epidemics (outbreaks). Objectives: 1. The analysis of incidence of measles in the last years in Timiș County; 2. Comparison with the situation from all our country and other countries; 3. Complex analysis regarding conditions for developing severe forms or complications; 4. Concrete measures regarding the evaluation of incidence of this disease. We have identified a low prevalence of pneumococcal colonization in pediatric patients with influenza. However, when colonization was present, it associated a significantly longer hospital stay and a significantly higher number of complications, highlighting the need for close monitoring and screening for pneumococcal colonization in children. Background Varicella is a highly contagious infectious disease, frequently encountered during childhood, with general receptivity and most often, with self-limited evolution. There are cases when varicella can present severe complications, such as acute encephalitis, cerebellitis, and rarely myelitis. Often, the host has a previous immunosuppression, such complications being rare in patients with a normal immunological status. Case report We present the case of a 10 year old girl, diagnosed 7 days prior with varicella, without any significant medical history, admitted in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof. Dr. Matei Balș\" for lower back pain, myalgias, muscle weakness, difficulty in walking. The onset of the symptoms was 3 days prior with an evolution towards exacerbation. Clinical exam upon admission confirmed varicella and furthermore, urinary retention with enlarged bladder, diminished patellar, right plantar clonus, decrease in muscle strength, myalgias, and paresthesias, coordination impairment in the lower limbs and asymmetric paraparesis predominantly on the right side. Workup was within the normal range. Myelitis was suspected and therefore a MRI of the head and spine was performed, which showed medullar inflammatory lesions in the cervicothoracic segment. Lumbar puncture was normal, except for a positive varicella-zoster virus PCR from CSF. Positive diagnosis consisted of cervicothoracic varicella-zoster virus myelitis. Treatment with acyclovir (60 mg/ kg/day), ceftriaxone 2 g/day, corticotherapy with methylprednisolone, human immunoglobulin, and iv fluids was promptly instituted for 14 days, with a slow favorable evolution. Paresthesias, motor deficit, urinary retention and sensitivity impairment resolved under treatment. Although this patient had a normal immunological status, she presented a severe complication of varicella, which required antiviral and cortisone treatment in high doses for an extended period of time, which eventually led to complete recovery.

Background Enteroviruses, a group of single-stranded RNA viruses, are commonly encountered infectious agents, especially in infants and children. They are responsible for a broad array of clinical manifestations, from herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), to myocarditis, aseptic meningitis. Traditionally enterovirus infections present with benign symptoms, taking the form of uncomplicated summer illnesses; during the summer of 2016 we registered a high number of severe, life threatening, forms of manifestation which required initial PIC management, long hospital management and, in some particular case of meningoencephalitis with associated motor sequelae, kinesiotherapy and physical therapy, fact that highlighted the associated burden of these summer infections. Background Combined antiretroviral therapy significantly improved the prognosis and the life expectancy of HIV patients. Along with this, the profile of HIV associated malignant pathologies has changed. Among them, lymphoma, having a higher incidence and a poorer prognosis than in general population, is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in HIV infected people. Case report We present two cases of HIV-associated lymphoma with different outcome. In the first case, a newly HIV diagnosed patient, with a good immunological status (lymphocytes CD4 count 442/cmm, HIV-RNA = 193502 copies/mL), developed non-Hodgkin's Burkitt-type lymphoma and he had a fulminant evolution towards death. In the second case, a patient known for over twenty years with HIV infection and who had discordant immunological and virological response to antiretroviral therapy (lymphocytes CD4 count 19/cmm, undetectable HIV-RNA), was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and he had a favorable evolution with chemotherapy. Both patients presented with systemic extranodal involvement, B symptoms and were classified in stage IV lymphoma. The extranodal involvement included central nervous system and liver in the case of the patient with non-Hodgkin's Burkitt-type lymphoma and liver and spleen involvement in the case of patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Both patients required exhaustive medical investigations and a close interdisciplinary cooperation during the entire time of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Conclusions HIV-associated lymphoma manifests in various forms in clinical settings. Unlike in general population, HIV-associated lymphoma is usually more aggressive and has a poor prognostic. Therefore it must be included into the differential diagnosis panel in patients presenting with sudden increase in lymph nodes, neurological manifestation and abrupt decrease in CD4 lymphocytes count. HIV-associated lymphoma differential diagnosis involves a wide panel of infectious and oncologic pathologies, therefore extensive investigation and the implication of specialists from various medical fields are required. A fast and accurate diagnosis may warrant the future evolution of the patients.

Background Among immunocompetent hosts the enteroviral infections are most frequently benign and auto-limited illnesses. Exceptionally these summer viral pathologies can evolve dramatically, presenting under severe forms of disease, with important associated complications sometimes leading to death. In the present paper we present the clinical evolution of an acute Coxsackie virus infection in an immunocompetent child, complicated by pancytopenia. Case report A young baby girl, 11 months of age, without any particular pathologic medical history is submitted in the 9 th Pediatric Department at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof. Dr. Matei Balș\" for fever, poor feeding, sleepiness and diarrhea. The clinical onset, registered 48 hours before her hospital submission was characterized by fever and poor feeding. The initial clinical evolution found a moderately ill appearing child, with pallor identified, without associated petechiae or bruising and without any other particular exanthematous elements, with a stable cardio-circulatory status, with no clinical signs of renal function impairment, diarrheal stools emitted, no nuchal rigidity or neurological focal signs present. The laboratory investigations isolated a franc pancytopenia (NL = 1.600/cmm, Hb = 8.8 g/dL, PLT = 105.000/cmm), with no other pathological findings. The serological screening for HIV, HTLV, adenovirus, EBV, CMV, Parvovirus, Influenza came back negative, with a normal peripheral smear and bone marrow aspiration. No clinical relevant result was communicated by the microbiological laboratory (negative hemocultures, nasal and pharyngeal swabs, uroculture and stool cultures). A positive IgM serology for Coxsackie virus was obtained. Cortisone, i.v. immunoglobulin, endovenous hydration and supportive therapy were initiated, with subsequent favorable evolution, with rapid normalization of the hemogram parameters (a discrete hypochromic anemia persists at a level previously identified in the infant) and clinical restoration. The acute Coxsackie virus infection in the immunocompetent pediatric population can sometimes evolve severely, complicated by acute diarrheal manifestations with subsequent dehydration and possible hematological involvement. In evolution the presented case maintained a residual anemia (Hb = 10.8 g/dL), with no other para-clinical imbalances.

Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the liver, the overall incidence of approximately 626,000 cases annually, with predominance in males. HCC is considered the third leading cause of death from malignancy and the second leading cause of death respectively in the field of digestive cancers. These patients are 80 % previously diagnosed with hepatitis B or C. The incidence of HCC in patients diagnosed with cirrhosis of viral B and C etiology is increasing, overall survival at 5 years continues to remain below 10 % due on the one hand to the discovery of tumors in advanced stages, ineffective screening in patients with risk factors for HCC and on the other hand to the lack of curative therapies applicable to this category of patients. Curative or palliative treatment of HCC depends mainly on local tumor extension and preexisting liver disease. Angiogenic agents of the type Sorafenib may cause an increase in overall survival by 44 % compared to placebo in patients with advanced HCC. Case report We present the case of a of 47 years old male, known with cirrhosis of viral etiology B from 2003, consumer of ethanol, who refused antiviral therapy with entecavir in 2009 and was diagnosed in February 2016 with HCC with extrahepatic extension. The patient was admitted in January 2016 at the Suceava Emergency Hospital with jaundice, fever, right upper quadrant pain, loss of appetite, weight loss. Clinical exam: patient with intense jaundice, emaciated, superficial lymph impalpable, ascites fluid quantity average, slightly sensitive right upper quadrant. Laboratory findings: significant hepatic cytolysis, cholestasis, elevated amylase, alpha-fetoprotein slightly elevated, thrombocytopenia, moderate inflammatory syndrome. CT and MRI exam revealed a nodular lesion in segment VI/VII with extra capsular extension and diaphragm and chest wall invasion. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry outlined trabecular hepatocellular carcinoma developed on a background of chronic active hepatitis advanced fibrosis. The patient has no indication for liver transplantation and liver resection, but could benefit from treatment with Sorafenib. The patient devloped important ascites, right massive pleurisy, hepatic encephalopathy phenomena and died 6 months after the diagnosis of HCC and one month after starting treatment with Sorafenib. Conclusions Current medical treatments are less effective in advanced HCC, and their role after liver transplantation, liver resection, should be explored further. Current hopes are turning to new molecular \"target\" therapies that explore the biological pathways involved in carcinogenesis signaling in the liver.

Background Influenza seasons represent a major strain on the health care system and they can vary in their severity, timing and duration from one season to another. Most of patients the infected with A H1N1 influenza virus exhibit no symptoms or very mild respiratory symptoms and high fever. In some cases, regardless of age or comorbidities, severe disease and complications due to infection, including death, may occur. Our case series study is meant to analyze the epidemiological, clinical and paraclinical characteristics of patients infected with type A H1N1 Influenza virus, admitted in the Intensive Care Department of INBI \"Prof. Dr. Matei Balș\" in the 2015-2016 influenza season. Methods A retrospective, observational case series study was conducted over a 6-month period, on 21 adult patients admitted in the Intensive Care Department, that have been confirmed with severe influenza infection through nasopharyngeal swab and tracheal secretion PCR analysis. In the same time, we collected data on demographics and comorbidities. Clinical data, microbiological samples and imagistics were extracted from patients' medical charts through thorough analysis. Eventually, therapeutic measures were statistically correlated with the outcome. The incidence of severe influenza cases in the Intensive Care Department was relatively low, but the severity was high; 28.5 % of the cases might have been prevented by following the recommendation for vaccination of risk groups in Romania. Background Measles is an acute infectious disease, highly contagious; the death among infants still remains in very high proportion (about 60 %) due to bronchopneumonia. Respiratory diseases are the result of measles virus with associated bacterial infection, which may include any respiratory area, secondary lesions, both viral and immune cellular depression. Case report We present the case of a child, 11 months old, female, unvaccinated, with multiple hospitalizations for bronchiolitis in the last 3-4 months, suppurative otitis, febrile convulsion syndrome, last hospitalization at \"Louis Turcanu\" Emergency Hospital for Children Timișoara, 10 days before presentation in our clinic for: emphysematous acute bronchiolitis, otitis media with effusion. Affirmative, 2 days after discharge the patient had fever, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, cough and some eruptive elements. The child was guided to our hospital by the general physician. At admission the child presented: influenced general condition, adynamia, nasal obstruction, cough with expiratory 3-4 secuses, saburral tongue, throat congestion, erythemato-macular elements eruptive with tendency to confluence on the face and chest, liver at 2 cm below the lower edge of the costal margin. Biological tests at admission: anemia, inflammatory syndrome present. A diagnosis of measles and bronchial hyperreactivity was suspected (subsequent anti measles IgM positive). Treatment was begun with water and electrolyte rebalancing treatment, bronchodilators, corticosteroids. Antibiotics were administrated after 2 days, due to the persistence of fever (isolated febrile hooks) and positive procalcitonin. After 4 days general condition was altered with polypnea, intercostal draft, oxygen saturation 85 % without oxygen mask, requiring transfer to intensive care. Endotracheal intubation was necessary, because of desaturation episodes, highlighting this radiological image: diffuse fog of both lung fields. In an attempt to extubate, the patient presents pulmonary edema and severe bronchospasm, requiring reintubation after 4 days. After about 2 weeks the child's respiratory status degrades, evolving to acute respiratory distress syndrome with metabolic acidosis and severe episodes of bradycardia. She is mechanically ventilated, but becomes oligoanuric, bradycardia does not respond to atropine then cardiopulmonary arrest occurs. Overall measles prognosis is favorable in children with satisfying nutritional status and good living conditions. Prognosis remains poor in children under 2 years with dystrophic syndromes (anemia, rickets) and multiple comorbidities.

Background Right-sided infectious endocarditis (IE) is a common condition in IV drug users (IVDU), Staphylococcus spp. being the most involved pathogen. Many IVDU are HIV positive, condition making them extremely susceptible to infections. Our aim is to present the challenges raised by the management of IE in an HIV positive IVDU. Case report A 27-year-old former IVDU, currently under methadone substitution, with HCV chronic infection, HIV infection (naive to treatment), was admitted into the hospital for fever (38.3°C), dyspnea on minimal exertion (SaO 2 = 87 % spontaneous), cough, generalized arthromyalgia, temporal-spatial disorientation. Taking into account the HIV status correlated with the severe general presentation and important lymphopenia, the patient had inserted a left jugular central venous line (CVL) for easier administration of medication, blood cultures were taken, and he was started on maximal antimicrobial therapy associated with dexamethasone and mannitol to treat a potential meningitis (later ruled out by lumbar puncture). The drug abuse history, the continuously deteriorating state urged for a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) that revealed 3 vegetations located on the tricuspid valve, evocative for IE. Therapy was adapted for a possible staphylococcal endocarditis (vancomycin IV 2 g q12h 3 days, and gentamycin IV 200 mg single dose 2 days), with diuretic and beta-blocker drugs. A few days later one blood culture came out positive for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). The diagnosis was IE with MSSA on tricuspid valve (revised Duke criteria: 1 major criterion -vegetations seen on TTE, 3 minor criteria: predisposing factors, one positive blood culture and fever), the antibiotherapy was changed again to oxacillin IV 12 g per day (7 days). Despite the correct treatment, the patient's evolution worsened (low fever, intense dyspnea, increased biologic inflammatory syndrome, pulmonary rales), the chest radiography was consistent with pneumonia, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, tuberculosis was excluded, but MSSA was confirmed (probable septic emboli). Blood cultures were taken from the CVL, and one was positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (the new finding was interpreted as a nosocomial infection due to the patient's poor adherence to the hygienic procedure involving the CVL). Linezolid was used for 2 weeks, and then oxacillin was resumed, completing a 6 week successful antibiotherapy. An HIV positive patient, especially an IVDU, is characterized by a great susceptibility to infections, making him a challenge for the physician to diagnose and treat. Even with adequate therapy, these patients are prone to develop life-threatening complications, mainly because of poor adherence to treatment. The data presented above show us great seriousness of respiratory infections with influenza with quick development of respiratory failure, requiring advanced support through IOT + VM method, imminent help, but increasing the risk of superinfection. Extremely severe bacterial infections with multiple resistance, create great difficulties in ensuring the success of bacteriological control. To optimize this success particular material resources are needed, to cover the acquisition of highest technology and the latest equipment, as well as human resources, highly qualified and experienced practice to be able to make quick decisions, accurate and responsible multidisciplinary working groups.  In the Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases, Constanța, Romania, SARI mortality was zero. The receptive population was unprotected by vaccination and mostly consisted of adults with comorbidities. AH1N1 was the most prevalent subtype in the flu in season 2015-2016. Background Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation, infections, neoplasms and autoimmune diseases. Its biological activity is exerted through two mechanisms which involve the binding of IL-6 to a specific membrane receptor, abbreviated as IL-6R (classic signaling pathway) or the binding of IL-6 to the soluble form of the receptor, abbreviated as sIL-6R (trans signaling pathway); this step is followed by the interaction between the previously formed complex and the transducer subunit (gp 130). The investigation of the intracellular signaling pathways, by which IL-6 mediates pro-and anti-inflammatory effects in viral infections, represents the aim of our prospective study. The persistence of HBsAg after the acute phase was detected in 64.4 % of cases. In 15.6 % we observed evolution towards chronicity. Evolution toward healing (seroconversion) was seen in 20 % of cases, after 12 months after the acute phase. Background Bacterial infection or colonization during pregnancy may be innocuous or may lead to significant consequences for the mother or the fetus. Early diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial treatment are essential steps towards the best possible pregnancy outcome. We have identified fairly low prevalences of cervical pathogens in a population of pregnant female patients closely monitored in a tertiary care hospital in Bucharest, Romania. Our results suggest that screening for Klebsiella should be performed earlier in pregnancy and that younger women have higher incidences of fungal infections. We identified a fairly low prevalence of GBS colonization (5.8 %) and one case of urinary GBS infection during pregnancy. Our study did not reveal major risk factors for GBS colonization or infection in this cohort of pregnant women from Southern Romania. Despite major advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease, management of these patients remains a challenge for clinicians as they do not respond or achieve only transient responses. Easy and constant access to antiretroviral therapy is essential and stem-cell transplantation should be considered but prevention programs, standardized nationally and integrated internationally, need to become a public health priority. In clinical practice, sometimes we meet cases that prove to be a real professional challenge. This bacillary meningoencephalitis raised some diagnosis issues because of the atypical onset (acute), the presence of a rough meningeal syndrome and therapy problems linked to the appearance of the hepatocytolysis syndrome.

The clinical presentation is polymorphic and nonspecific, but most often characterized by: self-limited influenza-like illness, pneumonia or hepatitis. On the other hand, there are other clinical forms, which are less frequent like: cardiovascular, neurologic, obstetric manifestations and dermatologic (5-20 %) in the form of erythema nodosum or other nonspecific exanthemas, maculopapular rash or diffuse punctiform pruritic rash. Case report We report the case of a 53 year old Caucasian female, consumer of raw milk, who presented for clinical and diagnostic reevaluation of a persistent fever. Initially, the case was diagnosed as an acute acalculous cholecystitis (cholestatic syndrome associated with hepatic cytolysis and thick gallbladder wall at CT) and treated with ertapenem and ciprofloxacin, under which the patient became afebrile, but the fever reappeared as soon as she left the hospital. At the time of admission in our clinic, the case was considered as an angiocholitis and treated initially with ampicillin/sulbactam, but after 48 h we escalated to piperacillin/ tazobactam and doxycycline and then to meropenem and doxycycline (9 days of meropenem and 5 days of doxycycline) because the patient presented relapsing fever under treatment (maximum 39°C). At day 6 of hospitalization, the patient developed erythematous, indurated nodules, not sharply marginated, with 2-3 cm in diameter, located on the anterior lower legs. Investigations were extended for finding the etiology of this new manifestation, diagnosed after the histopathologic examination as erythema nodosum. We excluded: pulmonary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, streptococcal, Yersinia, Salmonella and Mycoplasma infections, cholangiocarcinoma, genital cancer. The only positive finding was positive IgM antibodies for Coxiella burnetii. We reintroduced doxycycline, despite lack of response at the beginning of hospitalization and soon after that the fever remitted. Repeating the Coxiella serology we still found high antibodies titer and the favorable evolution of erythema nodosum under doxycycline pleaded for the diagnosis of Q fever. Moreover, it is important to mention that the patient forgot to take her treatment for 1 day, which determined the apparition of new nodules. The evolution of these new lesions was favorable, a compatible aspect of a therapeutic confirmation of the diagnosis, which confirmed once more the efficacy of our management. The case is highlighting a rare clinical form of Q fever and its particularities of evolution with a slow response to the usual therapy. At the same time our case is illustrating the differential diagnosis of persistent fever and associated erythema nodosum.

Most often it is due to inappropriate treatment with corticosteroids (steroidmodified tinea), systemic or topical, prescribed for some pre-existing pathology or given mistakenly for the treatment of misdiagnosed tinea. The inflammation and scaly, typical clinical signs of dermatophytoses, are suppressed making the diagnosis difficult. The usual sites where this problem occurs are the face, groins, lower legs, and hands. Longstanding steroid modified cases may require prolonged oral antifungal therapy. Great progress has been made in the management of ARDS. Nowadays novel agents and techniques are available, including antimicrobial drugs, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, as well as supportive treatment (advanced mechanical ventilation). It seems that only the subgroup of patients with relative mild, early ARDS are likely to benefit from non-invasive ventilation. Background Granulicatella species are nutritionally variant streptococci. They are a normal component of the oral flora, but have been associated with a variety of invasive infections in humans, especially bacterial endocarditis or abdominal abscesses. Recently, Granulicatella elegans was isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) as well. CNS involvement has to be early recognized since Granulicatella infections have an increased morbidity and mortality as well as great bacteriologic failure and relapse rates. Case report We present a case of a 53 years-old woman with meningitis, first considered to be tuberculosis (TB). She received antiTB treatment, including streptomycin. Seven days after treatment initiation, the general condition improved, but the patient experienced bilateral deafness as well as severe disequilibrium, documented by pure tone audiometry and vestibular investigations (posturography, videonystagmography and video head impulse test -HIT). These permanent sensorial deficits have a huge negative impact on quality of lifepatient cannot communicate anymore, walk alone or perform daily activities. Together with appropriate new antibiotic treatment for Granulicatella infection, hearing aid and vestibular rehabilitation program were recommended. Very few cases of Granulicatella meningitis are reported and none with hearing and equilibrium deficit secondary to this infection. We consider this case as a cochleo-vestibular bilateral deficit secondary to meningitis more than to ototoxic treatment, since in the majority of adult cases with ototoxic lesions, aminoglycosides affects only one of the sensorial structures from the inner earhearing sensory epithelium or vestibular one, but not both. Granulicatella induce invasive infections. Rapid initiation of adequate antibiotic therapy minimizes the severity of the disease as well as long-term sequels. In this case, sudden severe bilateral onset of the hearing loss limited communication and permanent hearing loss will be partially compensated by the hearing aids. Regarding bilateral vestibular deficit, rehabilitation is very difficult and long-lasting, with dramatically limitations in daily activities.

Background Chickenpox is a common childhood infectious disease, very contagious, usually benign and self-limited, and complications are believed to be rare. Clostridium difficile colitis represents an important cause of morbidity in children, with high numbers of relapses and sometimes, with a severe life threatening evolution. Fecal microbiota transplantation represents an efficient alternative therapy to Clostridium difficile colitis which is unresponsive to standard treatment. Background Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease caused by a wide variety of pathogens and may be a professional challenge. In 1901, Sir William Osler noted in the fourth edition of his book, \"The Principles and Practice of Medicine\", that pneumonia is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality of all acute diseases. More than a century later, the prominence of pneumonia did not change, the pneumonia being one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Objectives: to establish the demographic and clinical aspects, evolution and etiology of CAP. Although varicella pneumonia is the most common cause of dyspnea, myocarditis can be a complication of chickenpox that determines shortness of breath. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of this rare form of myocarditis can lead to complete recovery of the patient. Consent Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this Case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor of this journal. Although it is exceptionally rare now, diphtheria should not be excluded as differential diagnosis, especially given the latest Romanian epidemiological report that shows a decrease to 65 % in childhood vaccination rate and no immunization booster in adulthood. Natural therapy may at times have a harmful effect, such as the one described in the aforementioned case, or it can produce drug-drug interactions which can increase/decrease the efficacy of medical therapy. Candida stomatitis is more frequent in urban areas (463 cases/year), more than half being men (232/year) and little children. More studies are needed in order to evaluate the involvement of different Candida species in the infections. More laboratory confirmation data are needed and a very good collaboration between laboratory doctors, clinicians and epidemiologists is strictly necessary. There is an important increase in anthrax cases in south-eastern Romania, all in animal-breeders, connected with an inappropriate veterinary surveillance. Not all cutaneous forms had a rapid good evolution, one developed potential fatal complications. The anthrax meningo-encephalitis described here had an unexpected favorable outcome, probable due to the young age, good previous health, early suspicion and prompt treatment.

The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in 2014 has exerted a great pressure on healthcare systems both inside, but also outside the African continent, in the attempt to identify and manage imported cases in order to prevent further transmission. In Romania, the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof. Dr. Matei Balş\" was the designated medical facility to manage possible cases of EVD. Our study aims to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and risk perception of the Institute's healthcare workers (HCWs) regarding Ebola virus disease and the recent epidemic. Most HCWs possess significant knowledge about Ebola virus disease. During the African epidemic, they experienced a moderate degree of worry and relied mostly on information provided at the Institute. Our study reveals the importance of professional education offered to employees by medical institutions and could help improve training sessions held during public health emergency situations. Extensive masses due to abdominopelvic actinomycosis raise challenging diagnostic and therapeutic problems due to frequent confusions with malignant tumors. First-line therapy includes high doses of penicillin over a prolonged period up to 6 months. Data concerning other antibiotics or shorter courses of therapy in actinomycosis are limited. We present a case of abdominopelvic actinomycosis with a complete remission after 42 days of penicillin combined with 21 days of tigecycline, in a 42 year-old woman hospitalized in \"Matei Balș\" National Institute for Infectious Diseases between 22.02-05.04.2016, who was later followed for 12 weeks after treatment. Case report A 43 year-old woman with solitary right kidney and a 12-year history of an intrauterine device presented to the urology department of \"Sf. Ioan\" Clinical Emergency Hospital for a 2-month history of nausea, abdominal pain, 8 kg weight loss and dysuria. Imaging and laboratory investigations revealed severe anemia, obstructive renal failure, right ureterohydronephrosis and a large retroperitoneal mass of 10 cm × 9 cm × 10.4 cm involving the right ovary and uterus, invading the sigmoid, rectum, urinary bladder and compressing the right ureter. A double J stent and a urinary catheter were placed. The patient was consulted in the surgery ward for what was believed to be a metastatic ovarian carcinoma. Exploratory laparoscopy revealed dense but friable adhesions allowing only a left anexectomy with partial omentectomy and impeding a complete resection. Histological samples showed an inflammatory granulomatous tissue with multiple abscesses containing colonies of Actinomyces spp. and the patient was referred to the \"Matei Balș\" National Institute for Infectious Diseases. The patient was started on penicillin 12 million units/day for a total of 42 days. After the first 10 days of penicillin, tigecycline (100 mg/day) was added for 21 days for the treatment of concurrent urinary infection with MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to colistin and sensitive only to tigecycline and fosfomycin. The patient had a favorable clinical and biologic outcome. A CT assessment after 4 and 12 weeks revealed complete remission of the abdominopelvic mass with right ureterohydronephrosis and a few small abdominal adenopathies (<11 mm). The case highlights the favorable effect of tigecycline for 21 days associated with the standard therapy of penicillin in a case of abdominopelvic actinomycosis with a remission at 6 weeks of therapy. Consent Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this Case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor of this journal. Background Raoultella planticola is a gram-negative bacillus that was primarily considered as environmental bacteria, belonging to family Enterobacteriaceae and related to Klebsiella spp. R. planticola is sensitive to cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones; strains of R. planticola with resistance to almost all clinically available antibiotics except tigecycline and colistin have been reported. The reports of R. planticola infections are limited; this bacterium has been reported in cholecystitis, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, pancreatitis and pneumonia. In pediatric population vitamin D deficiency was associated with sepsis and higher PRISM-III score. In HIV-infected patients DR-TB caused was associated with previous treatment, lower median CD4 cell-count and increased in-hospital mortality. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding the TB site. The rate of MDR was greater than in HIV non-infected patients. Background Some urinary infections are considered to be triggers for interstitial nephropathies. The most frequent urinary infections are determined by bacteria, rarely by viruses or yeasts. The authors aimed to evaluate if kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) could represent a specific serological marker in patients with urinary tract infections susceptible to develop kidney dysfunction. These results sustain the idea that KIM-1 could be a prediction factor for renal dysfunction in patients with urinary infections. Increased levels of serum gangliosides in patients with BPH could be considered a defense mechanism against infections, important in maintaining a vital biological balance. Serum gangliosides could represent a useful monitoring parameter in patients with obstructive prostate benign hyperplasia and urinary infections. Background Toxocariasis is caused by a series of related nematode species that routinely infect dogs and cats throughout the world. This study is a warning on geographical regions underestimated. In the region of Moldova (Iași) toxocariasis is frequent in dogs, cats and foxes. In the presented case, the clinical and radiological findings were insufficient to allow the differentiation between tuberculous and staphylococcal etiology. Additionally, the activity of anti-staphylococcal agents such as rifampin and linezolid on Mycobacterium tuberculosis masked the clinical progression of the disease and further prolonged the time to etiological diagnosis. Bacteriological tests failed to identify the etiologic agent, and the definite diagnosis was eventually based on histopathologic examination, highlighting the importance of obtaining a tissue specimen to allow accurate diagnosis and correct interdisciplinary management. Consent Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this Case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor of this journal.  Although type B of RSV didn't give severe clinical forms, in the case of the child aged 2.9 years, RSV type B induced a severe clinical form which resulted in death. In patients with associated chronic diseases, RSV can cause either death or serious infections. Infections like flu and infections due to RSV can spread easily in the community. Pathogenicity mechanisms for understanding this infection are needed along with more studies for genotyping and gene sequencing of RSV. Background Postoperative sepsis occurring in immunocompromised elderly patients, imposes complex clinical-therapeutic monitoring, and is known as an important cause of mortality in this population. The purpose of the paper is to present a clinical case with Acinetobacter baumannii sepsis associated with Clostridium difficile enterocolitis in an elderly immune suppressed patient. Early detection of postoperative sepsis associated with infection with C. difficile, alongside effective therapeutic clinical monitoring can help increase life expectancy in elderly immunocompromised patients. Our study identified a psychological risk profile of people living with HIV/AIDS in Romania and we concluded that every single risk factor should be addressed properly by a specialist multidisciplinary team. The WHO Experts on Influenza Antiviral Susceptibility work closely to promote understanding of the means of prevention, treatment and control of influenza virus diseases, including the emergence of antiviral resistance. Due to the high prevalence of resistance to the adamantane class of drugs among influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic strain, neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are currently the only antivirals used in treatment of respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses and less in their prevention -in Romania. Because current pharmaceutical options for treating influenza infection and the opportunity of their use in prophylaxis therapy are limited, there remains a critical need for surveillance on NAI susceptibility of influenza viruses circulating worldwide and also in Romania. The National Influenza Center of the Cantacuzino Institute performs laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza viruses, including antiviral susceptibility testing. Due to the implementation of sensitive and functional testing for antiviral susceptibility of influenza viruses circulating during the last 3 epidemic seasons, the number of samples tested in Romania has been increasing. Recorded values are in the baseline of the characteristic strains, still being sensitive to antivirals. Continuous monitoring of antiviral susceptibility is needed to allow early detection of resistant strains. Background Sepsis remains a major problem of modern medicine despite considerable medical advances in recent decades. The undeniable relevance of this condition is explained by the increasing incidence, high mortality, and high economic costs related to treatment. More than 750,000 cases of sepsis occur annually in the United States and this number has been increasing over the years, and the cost of treatment is estimated to be 17 billion USD per year. In Europe the number of sepsis cases annually recorded is approximately 500,000 cases, and according to the data reported by several authors the number of fatalities would vary between 30 % and 90 %. The most common pathogens identified in the etiology of sepsis were the species of Staphylococcus, which corresponds to some literature data.\n",

      "\tAlthough heterotypic secondary infection with dengue virus (DENV) is associated with severe disease, the majority of secondary infections are mild or asymptomatic. The mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection are poorly understood. In 2010, 108 DENV3-positive cases were enrolled in a pediatric hospital-based study in Managua, Nicaragua, with 61 primary and 47 secondary infections. We analyzed DENV-specific neutralization titers (NT 50 ), IgM and IgG avidity, and antibody titer in serum samples collected during acute and convalescent phases and 3, 6, and 18 months post-infection. NT 50 titers peaked at convalescence and decreased thereafter. IgG avidity to DENV3 significantly increased between convalescent and 3-month time-points in primary DENV infections and between the acute and convalescent phase in secondary DENV infections. While avidity to DENV2, a likely previous infecting serotype, was initially higher than avidity to DENV3 in secondary DENV infections, the opposite relation was observed 3-18 months post-infection. We found significant correlations between IgM avidity and NT 50 in acute primary cases and between IgG avidity and NT 50 in secondary DENV infections. In summary, our findings indicate that IgM antibodies likely play a role in early control of DENV infections. IgG serum avidity to DENV, analyzed for the first time in longitudinal samples, switches from targeting mainly cross-reactive serotype(s) to the current infecting serotype over time. Finally, serum avidity correlates with neutralization capacity.\n",

This vaccine consists of two plasmids expressing CMV antigens glycoprotein B (gB) and phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) formulated with a CRL1005 poloxamer and benzalkonium chloride (BAK) delivery system designed to enhance plasmid expression. The vaccine's planned initial indication under investigation is for prevention of CMV reactivation in CMV-seropositive (CMV + ) recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 proof-of-concept study provided initial evidence of the safety of this product in CMV + HCT recipients who underwent immune ablation conditioning regimens. This study revealed a significant reduction in viral load endpoints and increased frequencies of pp65-specific interferon-γproducing T cells in vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients. The results of this endpoint-defining trial provided the basis for defining the primary and secondary endpoints of a global phase 3 trial in HCT recipients.

The etiologic agent, CCHF orthonairovirus (CCHFV), can infect several mammals in nature but only seems to cause clinical disease in humans. Over the past two decades there has been an increase in total number of CCHF case reports, including imported CCHF patients, and an expansion of CCHF endemic areas. Despite its increased public health burden there are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments to prevent CCHF. We here report the development and assessment of the protective efficacy of an adenovirus (Ad)-based vaccine expressing the nucleocapsid protein (N) of CCHFV (Ad-N) in a lethal immunocompromised mouse model of CCHF. The results show that Ad-N can protect mice from CCHF mortality and that this platform should be considered for future CCHFV vaccine strategies.\n",

Among the 18 regions of Henan, Xinyang is with the heaviest epidemic, and it is currently also with the highest daily increment. We found that 55% patients in Henan were male, which is apparently higher than the females. We found that the gender difference of patients in Henan is 1.2226 : 1, while from Yang et al. [4] , they reported that the gender difference for 4021 patients from over 30 provinces is 0.31 : 0.27 = 1.1481 : 1. Our result is close to the existing ones. We reported that the MFRs of the whole province and its 18 regions are not the main factor that results to the gender difference in patients. Two possible main factors that result to such gender difference of patients include 1) the expression and distribution of ACE2s were wider in male patients than those in females, and 2) males are more active and with wider social activities than females in many regions of Henan. The ages of patients generally follow normal distribution, and with more than 81% patients are aged between 21 and 60 years old. N a n y a n g C e n tr a l H o s p . Incubation period is very important but very difficult to be estimated, since it is difficult to know when the patients were infected. We define the period from firstly contacting with suspicious persons or recently return from Wuhan to firstly appearing clinical symptoms (fever, cough etc) as incubation period, and we estimate its distribution. Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the average estimated incubation period was 7.4 days, the mode was 4 days. About 55% patients were with incubation periods lower than 7 days, while more than 92% patients were lower than 14 days. About 7.45% patients were overestimated with more than 14 days incubation periods. Based on ME, OLS and MLE approaches, we modeled the incubation period as logarithmic normal distributions, and we found the ME method can well mimic the long right tails of the PDF for the incubation periods. Based on the ME approach, interquartile range of theoretically estimated incubation period is between 4.1 and 9.4 days. It is noted that, due to .

      "\tBACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date. The RCOG and RCPCH have provided interim guidance to help maternity and neonatal services plan their response to COVID-19. BACKGROUND The common human coronaviruses; 1. 229E (alpha coronavirus), 2. NL63 (alpha coronavirus), 3. OC43 (beta coronavirus) and 4. HKU1 (beta coronavirus) cause the common cold. Three human coronaviruses cause more severe, acute illnesses; MERS-CoV causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS, SARS-CoV causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS and SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women.\n",

Abstract 1 2 BACKGROUND: Rapid triaging, as in the current COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on age and pre-existing 3 medical conditions. In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) 4 to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not 5 feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for 6 cardiorespiratory risk. 7 METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with 8 pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise. 9 Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from 10 underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point 11 Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-12 planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and patient-specific 13 variables. 14 RESULTS: In the 26 patients (aged 21-77, median 57 years), anaerobic threshold ranged from 7.6-24.5 15 (median 12.35) ml.min -1 kg -1 and placed more than half of the patients (15, 57.7%) in the >11 ml.min -16 1 kg -1 category suggested as \"lower-risk\" for intra-abdominal surgeries. Neither age nor baseline SpO2 17 predicted anaerobic threshold, or lower/higher risk categories, either alone or in multivariate analyses, 18 despite baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) ranging from 79 to 99 (median 92)%, haemoglobin from 108 19 to 183 (median 156)g.L -1 . However, lower haemoglobin, and particularly, arterial oxygen content and 20 oxygen pulse, were associated with increased cardiorespiratory risk: Modelling a haemoglobin increase 21 of 25g.L -1 placed a further 7/26 (26.9%) patients in a lower risk category. For patients completing the 22 VSAQ, derived metabolic equivalents were strongly associated with anaerobic threshold, enabling risk 23 evaluations through a simple questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline exercise tolerance may override age and diagnostic labels in triage settings. These data support approaches to risk reduction by aerobic conditioning and attention to anaemia. The VSAQ is suggested as a rapid screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk assessment to implement during 27 triage/screening. All rights reserved.

A different picture emerged when examining markers of oxygen delivery to the tissues, thus confirming 182 that the study did have sufficient power to be discerning: First, the higher risk groups had a trend towards lower haemoglobin, although there was some overlap 185 in confidence intervals. Categorised by an anaerobic threshold delimiter of 11 ml.min -1 kg -1 , the mean 186 [95% CI] values were 159 [14.9, 17.0] g.L -1 for the low risk group compared to 144 [13.1, 15.6] g.L -1 187 for the high risk group (Table 1, Figure 3) .

      "\tAll of these institutions are in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Abstract Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE-2) as the cellular entry receptor to infect the lower respiratory tract. Because individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19, we determined whether ACE-2 expression in the lower airways was related to COPD and cigarette smoking. Methods: Using RNA-seq, we determined gene expression levels in bronchial epithelia obtained from cytologic brushings of 6 th to 8 th generation airways in individuals with and without COPD. We eternally validated these results from two additional independent cohorts, which used microarray technologies to measure gene expression levels from 6 th to 12 th generation airways. In the discovery cohort (n=42 participants), we found that ACE-2 expression levels were increased by 48% in the airways of COPD compared with non-COPD subjects (COPD=2.52±0.66 log2 counts per million reads (CPM) versus non-COPD= 1.70±0.51 CPM , p=7.62×10 -4 ). There was a significant inverse relationship between ACE-2 gene expression and FEV1% of predicted (r=-0.24; p=0.035). Current smoking also significantly increased ACE-2 expression levels compared with never smokers (never current smokers=2.77±0.91 CPM versus smokers=1.78±0.39 CPM, p=0.024). These findings were replicated in the two eternal cohorts. Conclusions: ACE-2 expression in lower airways is increased in patients with COPD and with current smoking. These data suggest that these two subgroups are at increased risk of serious COVID-19 infection and highlight the importance of smoking cessation in reducing the risk.\n",

In the public data set, the percentage of men were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group, although age was comparable between men and women. Meaning: Male gender is a risk factor for worse outcome in patients with COVID independent of age and susceptibility. Importance: The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Disease has put the world on alert, that is reminiscent of the SARS outbreak seventeen years ago. Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (≥65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P<0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P<0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients.

      "\tBackground: Infections are often associated to comorbidity that increases the risk of medical conditions which can lead to further morbidity and mortality. SARS is a threat which is similar to MERS virus, but the comorbidity is the key aspect to underline their different impacts. One UK doctor says \"I'd rather have HIV than diabetes\" as life expectancy among diabetes patients is lower than that of HIV. However, HIV has a comorbidity impact on the diabetes. Results: We present a quantitative framework to compare and explore comorbidity between diseases. By using neighbourhood based benchmark and topological methods, we have built comorbidity relationships network based on the OMIM and our identified significant genes. Then based on the gene expression, PPI and signalling pathways data, we investigate the comorbidity association of these 2 infective pathologies with other 7 diseases (heart failure, kidney disorder, breast cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, bone diseases, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes). Phenotypic association is measured by calculating both the Relative Risk as the quantified measures of comorbidity tendency of two disease pairs and the φ-correlation to measure the robustness of the comorbidity associations. The differential gene expression profiling strongly suggests that the response of SARS affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response and statistically dysregulates a large number of genes, pathways and PPIs subnetworks in different pathologies such as chronic heart failure (21 genes), breast cancer (16 genes) and bone diseases (11 genes). HIV-1 induces comorbidities relationship with many other diseases, particularly strong correlation with the neurological, cancer, metabolic and immunological diseases. Similar comorbidities risk is observed from the clinical information. Moreover, SARS and HIV infections dysregulate 4 genes (ANXA3, GNS, HIST1H1C, RASA3) and 3 genes (HBA1, TFRC, GHITM) respectively that affect the ageing process. It is notable that HIV and SARS similarly dysregulated 11 genes and 3 pathways. Only 4 significantly dysregulated genes are common between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, including NFKBIA that is a key regulator of immune responsiveness implicated in susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases. Our method presents a ripe opportunity to use data-driven approaches for advancing our current knowledge on disease mechanism and predicting disease comorbidities in a quantitative way.\n",

      "\tGenetic background may play an important role in the process of SARS-CoV infection and SARS development. We found several proteins that could interact with the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). a-2-Heremans-Schmid Glycoprotein (AHSG), which is required for macrophage deactivation by endogenous cations, is associated with inflammatory regulation. Cytochrome P450 Family 3A (CYP4F3A) is an v-oxidase that inactivates Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in human neutrophils and the liver. We investigated the association between the polymorphisms of these two inflammationassociated genes and SARS development. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) maps of these two genes were built with Haploview using data on CHB+JPT (version 2) from the HapMap. A total of ten tag SNPs were selected and genotyped. In the Guangzhou cohort study, after adjusting for age and sex, two AHSG SNPs and one CYP4F3 SNP were found to be associated with SARS susceptibility: rs2248690 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-4.51); rs4917 (AOR 1.84; 95% CI 1.02-3.34); and rs3794987 (AOR 2.01; 95% CI 1.10-3.68). To further validate the association, the ten tag SNPs were genotyped in the Beijing cohort. After adjusting for age and sex, only rs2248690 (AOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.30-2.04) was found to be associated with SARS susceptibility. The combined analysis of the two studies confirmed tag SNP rs2248690 in AHSG as a susceptibility variant (AOR 1.70; 95% CI 1.37-2.09). The statistical analysis of the rs2248690 genotype data among the patients and healthy controls in the HCW cohort, who were all similarly exposed to the SARS virus, also supported the findings. Further, the SNP rs2248690 affected the transcriptional activity of the AHSG promoter and thus regulated the AHSG serum level. Therefore, our study has demonstrated that the AA genotype of rs2268690, which leads to a higher AHSG serum concentration, was significantly associated with protection against SARS development.\n",

      "\tBackground: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is driving many countries to adopt global isolation measures in an attempt to slow-down its spread. These extreme measures are associated with extraordinary economic costs. Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of global isolation of the whole population to focused isolation of individuals at high risk of being exposed, augmented by thorough PCR testing. Design: We applied a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (SEIR) model to compare two different strategies in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Data sources and target population: We modeled the dynamics in Israel, a small country with ~ 9 million people. Interventions: 1. Global isolation of the whole population (strategy 1) 2. Focused isolation of people at high risk of exposure with extensive PCR testing (strategy 2). Outcome measures: Number of deaths and the cost per one avoided death in strategy 1 vs 2. The number of expected deaths is 389 in strategy 1versus 432 in strategy 2. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in case of adhering to global isolation will be $ 102,383,282 to prevent one case of death. The ICER value is between $ 22.5 million to over $280 million per one avoided death. Conclusions: According to our model, global isolation will save ~43 more lives compared to a strategy of focused isolation and extensive screening. This benefit is implicated in tremendous costs that might result in overwhelming economic effects. Limitations: Compartment models do not necessarily fit to countries with heterogeneous populations.

These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread. The novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 quickly spread to all Chinese provinces and, as of February 6, 2020, to 24 other countries 1, 2 . Efforts to contain the virus are ongoing; however, given the many uncertainties regarding pathogen transmissibility and virulence, the effectiveness of these efforts is unknown. The fraction of undocumented but infectious cases is a critical epidemiological characteristic that modulates the pandemic potential of an emergent respiratory virus 3−6 . These undocumented infections often experience mild, limited or no symptoms and hence go unrecognised, and, depending on their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to virus than would otherwise occur. Here, to assess the full potential of COVID-19, we use a modelinference framework to estimate the contagiousness and proportion of undocumented infections in China during the weeks before and after the shutdown of travel in and out of Wuhan.\n",

      "\tIn this study, we propose a generalized SEIR model to analyze the epidemic of COVID-19, which was firstly reported in Wuhan last December and then quickly spread out nationwide in China. Our model properly incorporates the intrinsic impact of hidden exposed and infectious cases on the entire procedure of epidemic, which is difficult for traditional statistics analysis. A new quarantined state, together with the recovery state, takes replace of the original R state in the classical SEIR model and correctly accounts for the daily reported confirmed infected cases and recovered cases. Based on detailed analysis of the public data of NHC of China from Jan. 20th to Feb. 9th, we estimate several key parameters for COVID-19, like the latent time, the quarantine time and the basic reproduction number in a relatively reliable way, and predict the inflection point, possible ending time and final total infected cases for Hubei, Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, etc. Overall, the epidemic situations for Beijing and Shanghai are optimistic, which are expected to end up within two weeks (from Feb. 15th, 2020). Meanwhile, for most parts of mainland including the majority of cities in Hubei province, it will be no later than the middle of March. We should also point out that the situation in Wuhan city is still very severe. More effective policies and more efforts on medical care and clinical research are eagerly needed.

It is found that the latter can significantly reduce the percentage of people getting infected and the death toll. It is important to emphasize here that more testing has to be applied to individuals without symptoms, since those with symptoms contain themselves automatically in most cases. As improved testing capacities are built up, our approach may help to decide when alternative mitigation methods may not only complement, but eventually replace the current social distancing regime. This may help to minimize the socio-economical impacts resulting from severe social isolation policies. While social distancing is currently essential, it is of utmost importance that the testing capabilities are upgraded such that they cover large portions of affected populations in the near future. From our analysis we conclude that testing every individual without symptoms roughly every 10 days would reduce the reproduction number of Covid-19 to one and thereby stabilize the pandemic, which is very promising. After a while, fewer and fewer infected people (who spread the virus) will be detected. In this way, continued large scale testing can verify the success of the mitigation strategy. Mass testing should be continued beyond this point, though at a reduced frequency. This would allow to detect if the fraction of infected person tends to increase. If this were the case, testing frequencies should again be ramped up. In any case, unless the virus can be defeated completely and globally by reducing the number of infected individuals to zero, there is a risk of Corvid-19 re-emergence after such mitigation measures are abandoned. It remains to be emphasized that no claims are made regarding the quantitative accuracy of the presented model predictions, but it can be expected that the qualitative dynamic behavior and the tendencies are captured well. For further improvements of the predictions a more reliable data base for parameter tuning would be necessary. The model itself can be refined by accounting for different age groups and latency, which would involve additional parameters. In the future it would be of utmost interest to further investigate combined strategies with e.g. social distancing for old and endangered persons and high rate testing for the remaining population, including the work force.

      "\tfor useful comments and suggestions. All remaining errors are our own. We quantify the causal impact of human mobility restrictions, particularly the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, on the containment and delay of the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We employ a set of differencein-differences (DID) estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect. We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. We find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities. We find that the COVID-19 cases would be 64.81% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province, and 52.64% higher in the 16 non-Wuhan cities inside Hubei, in the counterfactual world in which the city of Wuhan were not locked down from January 23, 2020. We also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, but over time, the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated \"actual\" cases narrows significantly. We also find evidence that enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei province are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities elsewhere. 3 With a population of over 11 million, Wuhan is the largest city in Hubei, the most populous city in Central China, and the seventh most populous city in China. The city is also a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through and connecting to other major cities, and home to 82 colleges and more than 1 million college students.\n",

      "\tBackground: Acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) during childhood are often caused by respiratory viruses, result in significant morbidity, and have associated costs for families and society. Despite their ubiquity, there is a lack of interdisciplinary epidemiologic and economic research that has collected primary impact data, particularly associated with indirect costs, from families during ARIs in children. We conducted a 12-month cohort study in 234 preschool children with impact diary recording and PCR testing of nose-throat swabs for viruses during an ARI. We used applied values to estimate a virus-specific mean cost of ARIs. Results: Impact diaries were available for 72% (523/725) of community-managed illnesses between January 2003 and January 2004. The mean cost of ARIs was AU$309 (95% confidence interval $263 to $354). Influenza illnesses had a mean cost of $904, compared with RSV, $304, the next most expensive single-virus illness, although confidence intervals overlapped. Mean carer time away from usual activity per day was two hours for influenza ARIs and between 30 and 45 minutes for all other ARI categories. Conclusion: From a societal perspective, community-managed ARIs are a significant cost burden on families and society. The point estimate of the mean cost of community-managed influenza illnesses in healthy preschool aged children is three times greater than those illnesses caused by RSV and other respiratory viruses. Indirect costs, particularly carer time away from usual activity, are the key cost drivers for ARIs in children. The use of parent-collected specimens may enhance ARI surveillance and reduce any potential Hawthorne effect caused by compliance with study procedures. These findings reinforce the need for further integrated epidemiologic and economic research of ARIs in children to allow for comprehensive cost-effectiveness assessments of preventive and therapeutic options.\n",

There was no clear seasonality, but 78% of episodes occurred in Winter/Spring for Influenza compared to 32% for Rhinovirus. Participants, on average, suffered 0.49 ILI, and 0.29 virus-positive ILI episodes, with no significant effects of gender, age, or household size. In contrast to US and Australian community studies, the frequency of ILI decreased as the number of household members aged below 5 years increased (p = 0.006).

      "\tOver an entire single RSV season in coastal Kenya, nasal swabs were collected from members of 20 households every 3-4 days regardless of symptom status and screened for RSV nucleic acid. Next generation sequencing was used to generate >90% RSV full-length genomes for 51.1% of positive samples (191/374). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) observed during household infection outbreaks ranged from 0-21 (median: 3) while SNPs observed during single-host infection episodes ranged from 0-17 (median: 1). Using the viral genomic data alone there was insufficient resolution to fully reconstruct withinhousehold transmission chains. For households with clear index cases, the most likely source of infant infection was via a toddler (aged 1 to <3 years-old) or school-aged (aged 6 to <12 years-old) cooccupant. However, for best resolution of WAIFW within households, we suggest an integrated analysis of RSV genomic and epidemiological data. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading viral cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia during infancy 1 . Global estimates in 2015 indicated that RSV causes ~33.1 million episodes of acute lower respiratory tract illness annually, ~3.2 million of which lead to hospital admissions and ~60,000 deaths in hospitalized children aged under 5 years 1 . Despite this burden, our understanding of RSV transmission patterns during epidemics, including who infects the vulnerable infant populations remains incomplete 2 . Defining the patterns of RSV transmission during epidemics, and specifically Who Acquires Infection From Whom (WAIFW) has the potential to inform control strategies 3,4 . RSV transmission occurs during contact with an infectious person or contaminated environmental surfaces 5 . Households are considered an important setting for RSV spread due to likely close person-to-person contacts 6,7 . A family study in the United States in the 1970s showed that up to 46% of family members and 62% of infants in the household become infected once the virus is introduced into a household 8 . Since this study, important advances have been made in diagnostic sensitivity and characterisation of infection sources for household cases,\n",

      "\tHouseholds are high-intensity close-contact environments favorable for transmission of respiratory viruses, yet little is known for low-income settings. Methods. Active surveillance was completed on 47 households in rural coastal Kenya over 6 months during a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) were taken from 483 household members twice weekly irrespective of symptoms. Using molecular diagnostics, NPSs from 6 households were screened for 15 respiratory viruses and the remainder of households only for the most frequent viruses observed: rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus (HCoV; comprising strains 229E, OC43, and NL63), adenovirus (AdV), and RSV (A and B). Results. Of 16 928 NPSs tested for the common viruses, 4259 (25.2%) were positive for ≥1 target; 596 (13.8%) had coinfections. Detection frequencies were 10.5% RV (1780), 7.5% HCoV (1274), 7.3% AdV (1232), and 3.2% RSV (537). On average, each household and individual had 6 and 3 different viruses detected over the study period, respectively. Rhinovirus and HCoV were detected in all the 47 households while AdV and RSV were detected in 45 (95.7%) and 40 (85.1%) households, respectively. The individual risk of infection over the 6-month period was 93.4%, 80.1%, 71.6%, 61.5%, and 37.1% for any virus, RV, HCoV, AdV, and RSV, respectively. NPSs collected during symptomatic days and from younger age groups had higher prevalence of virus detection relative to respective counterparts. RSV was underrepresented in households relative to hospital admission data. Conclusions. In this household setting, respiratory virus infections and associated illness are ubiquitous. Future studies should address the health and economic implications of these observations.\n",

      "\tSimple Summary: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) affects the lower respiratory tract of cattle, causing high mortality. The syndrome has a multifactorial etiology and transport seems to favor pathogen proliferation. This study investigated the prevalence of different pathogens involved in BRD, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers collected before and after a long-distance journey. A total of 56 Limousine animals were included, travelling in three different shipments, on the same route from France to southern Italy in a semitrailer, on three different days from February to April. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNS)/steer were collected and tested by bimolecular analysis. Neither bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) nor bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) were detected. A higher prevalence of Histophilus somni was observed in the DNS collected during the third shipment in comparison with those registered during the first and the second one, probably due to a higher prevalence at departure. Conversely, the prevalence of bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis and Pasteurella multocida was higher on arrival in comparison with departure, confirming data reported in the literature. Overall, there were nasal microbiota changes in beef steers, with an increase in the prevalence of pathogens associated with BRD after travelling. Abstract: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a serious health and economic problem in the beef industry, which is often associated with transportation and caused by different pathogens. The prevalence of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers before and after the same long-distance journey from France to southern Italy was documented. Fifty-six Limousine animals of three different shipments, travelling on three different days from February to April, were included. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two DNS/animal were collected and tested by Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Univariate logistic regression was carried out, considering time and day as fixed factors and the outcome of qPCR for each pathogen as a dependent categorical dichotomous variable (positive/negative, 1/0). The fact that the number of H. somni positive animals were found to be higher in the third shipment than the first and second one, indicating that this pathogen was already present before loading, is relevant. The prevalence of BCoV, BRSV, M. haemolytica, M. bovis, P. multocida was higher at T1 than T0, suggesting that other factors, such as stress and the epidemiological status of the arrival farm, played a role. The tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in Animals 2019, 9, 1093 2 of 7 agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.\n",

Symptom data on 158 healthcare workers (HCWs) with a laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection were collected using standardized data collection forms from three separate studies. Overall, the rate of fever in confirmed viral respiratory infections in adult HCWs was 23·4% (37/158). Rates varied by virus: human rhinovirus (25·3%, 19/75), influenza A virus (30%, 3/10), coronavirus (28·6%, 2/7), human metapneumovirus (28·6%, 2/7), respiratory syncytial virus (14·3%, 4/28) and parainfluenza virus (8·3%, 1/12). Smoking [relative risk (RR) 4·65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·33-16·25] and coinfection with two or more viruses (RR 4·19, 95% CI 1·21-14·52) were significant predictors of fever. Fever is less common in adults with confirmed viral respiratory infections, including influenza, than described in children. More than 75% of adults with a viral respiratory infection do not have fever, which is an important finding for clinical triage of adult patients with respiratory infections. The accepted definition of 'influenza-like illness' includes fever and may be insensitive for surveillance when high case-finding is required. A more sensitive case definition could be used to identify adult cases, particularly in event of an emerging viral infection.\n",

      "\tAcute Respiratory Infections (ARI) are some of the most common human diseases worldwide. However, they have a complex and diverse etiology, and the characteristics of the pathogens involved in respiratory infections in developing countries are not well understood. In this work, we analyzed the characteristics of 17 common respiratory pathogens in children (#14 years old) with ARI in Guangzhou, southern China over a 3-year period using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Pathogens were identified in 2361/4242 (55.7%) patients, and the positivity rate varied seasonally. Ten of the 17 pathogens investigated showed positivity rates of more than 5%. The most frequently detected pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (768/2361, 32.5%), influenza A virus (428/2361, 18.1%), enterovirus (138/2361, 13.3%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (267/2361, 11.3%) and adenovirus (213/2361, 9.0%). Co-pathogens were common and found in 503 of 2361 (21.3%) positive samples. When ranked according to frequency of occurrence, the pattern of co-pathogens was similar to that of the primary pathogens, with the exception of human bocavirus, human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus. Significant differences were found in age prevalence in 10 of the 17 pathogens (p#0.009): four basic patterns were observed, A: detection rates increased with age, B: detection rates declined with age, C: the detection rate showed distinct peaks or D: numbers of patients were too low to detect a trend or showed no significant difference among age groups (p. 0.05). These data will be useful for planning vaccine research and control strategies and for studies predicting pathogen prevalence. Citation: Liu WK, Liu Q, Chen DH, Liang HX, Chen XK, et al.

Several 34 bioaerosol samplers and analytical methods have been used; however, the detection and 35 quantification of influenza virus among aerosol samples remains challenging. Therefore, 36 improved viral aerosol measurement methods are needed. This study evaluated influenza virus 37 recovery among three filter types polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride and polystyrene. 38 Polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride are fabricated filter materials and commonly used in 39 the scientific literature to sample for viral aerosols. A novel, electrospun polystyrene filter 40 material may improve viral aerosol recovery during filter-based air sampling. The filter materials 41 were compared across the following conditions: treated with or without air, filter wash buffer 42 (HBSS or PBS), and viral RNA extraction method (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or Trizol). 43 Twenty trials were completed in a chamber and samples were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Viral 44 recovery was significantly different (p-value < .0001) by filter type. Polystyrene filter use 45 resulted in recovery of the most viral RNA. Air sampling did not affect the recovery of viral 46 RNA from the filter materials (p-values > 0.05). Viral RNA concentrations were significantly 47 different across extraction methods for all comparisons (p-values < 0.05).

      "\tInfluenza D virus (IDV) is unique among four types of influenza viruses in that it utilizes cattle as a primary reservoir. The thermal and acid stability of IDV were examined and directly compared with those of influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus (IBV), and influenza C virus (ICV). The results of our experiments demonstrated that only IDV had a high residual infectivity (~2.5 log units of 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID 50 ]/ml) after a 60-min exposure to 53°C in solution at a neutral pH, and remarkably, IDV retained this infectivity even after exposure to 53°C for 120 min. Furthermore, the data showed that IDV was extremely resistant to inactivation by low pH. After being treated at pH 3.0 for 30 min, IDV lost only approximately 20% of its original infectiousness, while all other types of influenza viruses were completely inactivated. Finally, replacement of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins of a temperature-and acid-sensitive IAV with the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) protein of a stable IDV through a reverse genetic system largely rendered the recombinant IAVs resistant to high-temperature and low-pH treatments. Together, these results indicated that the HEF glycoprotein is a primary determinant of the exceptional temperature and acid tolerance of IDV. Further investigation into the viral entry and fusion mechanism mediated by the intrinsically stable HEF protein of IDV may offer novel insights into how the fusion machinery of influenza viruses evolve to achieve acid and thermal stability, which as a result promotes the potential to transmit across mammal species.\n",

      "\tBackground: The role of demographic factors, climatic conditions, school cycles, and connectivity patterns in shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza is not clearly understood. Here we analyzed the spatial, age and temporal evolution of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Chile, a southern hemisphere country covering a long and narrow strip comprising latitudes 17°S to 56°S. Methods: We analyzed the dissemination patterns of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic across 15 regions of Chile based on daily hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory disease and laboratory confirmed A/H1N1 influenza infection from 01-May to 31-December, 2009. We explored the association between timing of pandemic onset and peak pandemic activity and several geographical and demographic indicators, school vacations, climatic factors, and international passengers. We also estimated the reproduction number (R) based on the growth rate of the exponential pandemic phase by date of symptoms onset, estimated using maximum likelihood methods. Results: While earlier pandemic onset was associated with larger population size, there was no association with connectivity, demographic, school or climatic factors. In contrast, there was a latitudinal gradient in peak pandemic timing, representing a 16-39-day lag in disease activity from the southern regions relative to the northernmost region (P < 0.001). Geographical differences in latitude of Chilean regions, maximum temperature and specific humidity explained 68.5% of the variability in peak timing (P = 0.01). In addition, there was a decreasing gradient in reproduction number from south to north Chile (P < 0.0001). The regional mean R estimates were 1.6-2.0, 1.3-1.5, and 1.2-1.3 for southern, central and northern regions, respectively, which were not affected by the winter vacation period. Conclusions: There was a lag in the period of most intense 2009 pandemic influenza activity following a South to North traveling pattern across regions of Chile, significantly associated with geographical differences in minimum temperature and specific humidity. The latitudinal gradient in timing of pandemic activity was accompanied by a gradient in reproduction number (P < 0.0001). Intensified surveillance strategies in colder and drier southern regions could lead to earlier detection of pandemic influenza viruses and improved control outcomes.\n",

The results showed that high absolute humidity (measured by vapor pressure) was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with increased risks of all-cause and cardiorespiratory deaths, but not with increased risks of pneumonia and influenza deaths. The association between absolute humidity and mortality risks was found consistent among the two cities. An increasing pattern of influenza associated mortality risks was also found across the strata of low to high relative humidity, but the results were less consistent for temperature. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for people with chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases to take extra caution against influenza during hot and humid days in the subtropics and tropics.\n",

Out of the feed ingredients analyzed, soybean meal had greatest delta value in all three viruses, along with the highest concentration of remaining virus after 56 days of incubation.

      "\tMask ventilation and coughing during oro-tracheal suctioning produce aerosols that enhance nosocomial transmission of respiratory infections. We examined the extent of exhaled air dispersion from a human-patient-simulator during mask ventilation by different groups of healthcare workers and coughing bouts. The simulator was programmed to mimic varying severity of lung injury. Exhaled airflow was marked with tiny smoke particles, and highlighted by laser light-sheet. We determined the normalized exhaled air concentration in the leakage jet plume from the light scattered by smoke particles. Smoke concentration ≥20% was considered as significant exposure. Exhaled air leaked from mask-face interface in the transverse plane was most severe (267 ± 44 mm) with Ambu silicone resuscitator performed by nurses. Dispersion was however similar among anesthesiologists/ intensivists, respiratory physicians and medical students using Ambu or Laerdal silicone resuscitator, p = 0.974. The largest dispersion was 860 ± 93 mm during normal coughing effort without tracheal intubation and decreased with worsening coughing efforts. Oro-tracheal suctioning reduced dispersion significantly, p < 0.001, and was more effective when applied continuously. Skills to ensure good fit during mask ventilation are important in preventing air leakage through the mask-face interface. Continuous oro-tracheal suctioning minimized exhaled air dispersion during coughing bouts when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Respiratory failure is a serious complication of emerging infectious respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 1,2 , avian influenza 3 , influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection 4 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 5 . Supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and occasionally invasive mechanical ventilation are required for managing these patients 1-5 . During the major outbreak of SARS, it was found that procedures related to tracheal intubation 6 , oxygen administration ≥6 L/min, and NIV were independent risk factors for super-spreading nosocomial outbreaks affecting many healthcare workers in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China 7 . In a systematic review of aerosol generating procedures that might increase the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS to healthcare workers, mask ventilation and oro-tracheal suctioning increased the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals, CI) to 2.8 (1.3-6.4) and 6.2 (2.2-18.1), respectively 8 . In this respect, we have previously shown that the dispersion distances of exhaled plume along the sagittal and transverse planes were 200 and 220 mm, respectively, when bag-mask ventilation was attempted in a human-patient-simulator (HPS) 9 . Although the addition of a viral-bacterial filter eliminated forward leakage of exhaled air from the expiration diverter, leakage at the interface between the mask and the patient's face was increased to 340 mm along the transverse plane. It is unclear if the increased leakage along the transverse plane was due to the higher resistance with the filter or related to inefficient mask seal 9 . In addition, oro-tracheal suctioning may trigger coughing bouts that could further increase the spread of potentially infectious droplets. However, effective suction may limit the dispersion. Further studies are therefore required to examine if there are technical or human factors involved that\n",

Samples used for the diagnosis and experimental analysis must be completely inactivated, although methods for the inactivation of F. tularensis are limited. In this study, effective methods for the inactivation of F. tularensis SCHU P9 and five other strains were determined by comparisons of colony-forming units between treated and control samples. The results showed that F. tularensis SCHU P9 was denatured by heat treatment (94˚C for 3 min and 56˚C for 30 min), filtration with a 0.22 μm filter, and the use of various solutions (i.e. >70% ethanol, methanol, acetone, and 4% paraformaldehyde). F. tularensis SCHU P9 remained viable after treatment with 50% ethanol for 1 min, filtration with a 0.45 μm filter, and treatments with detergents (i.e. 1% lithium dodecyl sulfate buffer, 1% Triton X-100 and 1% Nonidet P-40) at 4˚C for 24 h. Additionally, F. tularensis SCHU P9 suspended in fetal bovine serum in plastic tubes was highly resistant to ultraviolet radiation compared to suspensions in water and chemically defined medium. The methods for inactivation of F. tularensis SCHU P9 was applicable to the other five strains of F. tularensis. The data presented in this study could be useful for the establishment of guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOP) to inactivate the contaminated samples in not only F. tularensis but also other bacteria.\n",

      "\tThe dynamics and significance of aerosol transmission of respiratory viruses are still controversial, for the major reasons that virus aerosols are inefficiently collected by commonly used air samplers and that the collected viruses are inactivated by the collection method. Without knowledge of virus viability, infection risk analyses lack accuracy. This pilot study was performed to (i) determine whether infectious (viable) respiratory viruses in aerosols could be collected from air in a real world environment by the viable virus aerosol sampler (VIVAS), (ii) compare and contrast the efficacy of the standard bioaerosol sampler, the BioSampler, with that of the VIVAS for the collection of airborne viruses in a real world environment, and (iii) gain insights for the use of the VIVAS for respiratory virus sampling. The VIVAS operates via a water vapor condensation process to enlarge aerosolized virus particles to facilitate their capture. A variety of viable human respiratory viruses, including influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and influenza B viruses, were collected by the VIVAS located at least 2 m from seated patients, during a late-onset 2016 influenza virus outbreak. Whereas the BioSampler when operated following our optimized parameters also collected virus aerosols, it was nevertheless overall less successful based on a lower frequency of virus isolation in most cases. This side-by-side comparison highlights some limitations of past studies based on impingement-based sampling, which may have generated false-negative results due to either poor collection efficiency and/or virus inactivation due to the collection process. IMPORTANCE The significance of virus aerosols in the natural transmission of respiratory diseases has been a contentious issue, primarily because it is difficult to collect or sample virus aerosols using currently available air sampling devices. We tested a new air sampler based on water vapor condensation for efficient sampling of viable airborne respiratory viruses in a student health care center as a model of a real world environment. The new sampler outperformed the industry standard device (the SKC BioSampler) in the collection of natural virus aerosols and in maintaining virus viability. These results using the VIVAS indicate that respiratory virus aerosols are more prevalent and potentially pose a greater inhalation biohazard than previously thought. The VIVAS thus appears to be a useful apparatus for microbiology air quality tests related to the detection of viable airborne viruses.\n",

      "\tBackground: Avian H5N1 influenza viruses present a challenge in the laboratory environment, as they are difficult to collect from the air due to their small size and relatively low concentration. In an effort to generate effective methods of H5N1 air removal and ensure the safety of laboratory personnel, this study was designed to investigate the characteristics of aerosolized H5N1 produced by laboratory manipulations during research studies. Results: Normal laboratory procedures used to process the influenza virus were carried out independently and the amount of virus polluting the on-site atmosphere was measured. In particular, zootomy, grinding, centrifugation, pipetting, magnetic stirring, egg inoculation, and experimental zoogenetic infection were performed. In addition, common accidents associated with each process were simulated, including breaking glass containers, syringe injection of influenza virus solution, and rupturing of centrifuge tubes. A micro-cluster sampling ambient air pollution collection device was used to collect air samples. The collected viruses were tested for activity by measuring their ability to induce hemagglutination with chicken red blood cells and to propagate in chicken embryos after direct inoculation, the latter being detected by reverse-transcription PCR and HA test. The results showed that the air samples from the normal centrifugal group and the negative-control group were negative, while all other groups were positive for H5N1. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there are numerous sources of aerosols in laboratory operations involving H5N1. Thus, laboratory personnel should be aware of the exposure risk that accompanies routine procedures involved in H5N1 processing and take proactive measures to prevent accidental infection and decrease the risk of virus aerosol leakage beyond the laboratory.\n",

The research community is interested to know what are the hotspots in coronavirus (CoV) research and how much is known about COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using a topic modeling analysis. : We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains all the 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to March 20, 2020. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained an eighttopic model from the corpus. We then analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections. Results: Eight topics emerged overall: clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. It was observed that COVID-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization, epidemiological study, and virus transmission at present. In contrast, topics about diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, genomics and pathogenesis only accounted for less than 10% or even 4% of all the COVID-19 publications, much lower than those of other CoV infections. Conclusions: These results identified knowledge gaps in the area of COVID-19 and offered directions for future research. : medRxiv preprint 6 topic coherence and human understanding. The final model is visualized as a bubble graph in Fig. 2, with one bubble representing one topic and the size indicating its popularity.

      "\tTo truly elucidate the role of bats as reservoirs for arboviruses, field surveillance studies documenting natural infection and transmission dynamics among vector and vertebrate species must be supplemented with experimental infections to characterize viremia profiles and infectiousness to vectors, virus-induced pathology, and immune kinetics following infection. With bats, these tasks are not trivial, and carry significant challenges in both the field and the lab. These challenges are evidenced by the few arboviruses for which there are substantial field and laboratory data involving the infection of bats. While many studies have presented serologic data indicative of past exposure of free-ranging bats to arboviruses of medical and veterinary importance, these studies should be followed up with laboratory assessments of reservoir host competence to shed light on the true epidemiological significance of the field data. Further, the detection of viral nucleic acid in free-ranging bats does not necessarily implicate the species as an arboviral reservoir. Rather, recovery and isolation of live virus at biologically relevant titers, and demonstrating the persistence of the pathogen in nature among connected populations of a potential reservoir species is more definitive. Unfortunately, few established bat colonies exist for use in vivo viral pathogenesis studies, limiting the achievability of these studies. To fulfill the vertebrate reservoir host paradigm, in vivo infections must support findings in the field. The isolation of Marburg virus from Egyptian rousette bats in Uganda in addition to experimental infections demonstrating viremia and shedding in the absence of overt pathology support the role of this bat species as the reservoir for Marburg virus [6, 7, 208] . For arboviruses, the combination of field work and in vivo pathogenesis studies are lacking. Still, several examples have emerged from this review that point to bats as potentially competent amplifying hosts for arboviruses. Kaeng Khoi virus was isolated from both bats and cimicid bugs in Thailand, and was also shown to be the causative agent behind sick mine workers [21] . Some bat species did develop a viremia at a level that would be infectious to mosquitoes when inoculated experimentally with CHIKV, and bats have been found exposed to CHIKV during field investigations [66, 143] . Experimental evidence supporting transmission of RRV from Pteropus poliocephalus to recipient mosquitoes in addition to identification of RRV-seropositive bats trapped in Australia and Indonesia highlights the need for further investigation into the role of bats in the ecology of this disease [75, 149, 157] . A mosquito-bat-mosquito transmission cycle was established in the lab for JBEV [67] . Serological evidence from the field documenting bat exposure to JBEV, the sustained viremia in bats during hibernation, and demonstration of mosquito transmission from and to bats in the laboratory collectively demonstrate the capability of bats to function as reservoir hosts for this virus. Circumstantial evidence from field-sampled mosquitoes and bats supports the cycling of Babanki virus among bats and mosquitoes in Uganda [29] , but experimental data are still lacking. For RVFV, bats evaluated in the lab have supported virus replication, and multiple populations of bats in the field have been found with neutralizing antibodies or natural infection with RVFV [1, 28, 29] . Additional studies are warranted on these and other viruses for which additional field or experimental data are needed to support the role of bats as a possible reservoir.

The current piece reviews a thematic series on surveillance-response systems for elimination of tropical diseases. Overall, 22 contributions covering a broad array of diseases are featuredi.e. clonorchiasis, dengue, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), H7N9 avian influenza, lymphatic filariasis, malaria, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), rabies, schistosomiasis and tuberculosis (TB). There are five scoping reviews, a commentary, a letter to the editor, an opinion piece and an editorial pertaining to the theme \"Elimination of tropical disease through surveillance and response\". The remaining 13 articles are original contributions mainly covering (i) drug resistance; (ii) innovation and validation in the field of mathematical modelling; (iii) elimination of infectious diseases; and (iv) social media reports on disease outbreak notifications released by national health authorities. Analysis of the authors' affiliations reveals that scientists from the People's Republic of China (P.R. China) are prominently represented. Possible explanations include the fact that the 2012 and 2014 international conferences pertaining to surveillance-response mechanisms were both hosted by the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases (NIPD) in Shanghai, coupled with P.R. China's growing importance with regard to the control of infectious diseases. Within 4 to 22 months of publication, three of the 22 contributions were viewed more than 10 000 times each.

It remains a rare cause of disease in a geographically defined region of the world known for the concurrent presence of infected camel hosts. Much of what we know about MERS relates to severe disease. Travel-related cases continue to challenge the rest of the world's surveillance and response capabilities, and we need more data to understand unexplained primary transmission. Signs of genetic change in MERS-CoV have been recorded, but it remains unclear whether they change clinical disease. How camels came to carry the virus they live with today remains unknown, but it is academic for the control of MERS. To date, human-to-human transmission has been inefficient, but virus surveillance and characterisation will ensure any change to the status quo is identified. MERS-CoV is not currently a pandemic threat; it is spread with the aid of human habit and error. Nevertheless, a much needed therapeutic toolbox is being developed, and in this process we are learning more about how CoVs cause disease, how they confound our immune responses, where they come from, and how to prevent and treat their respiratory infections [90] . Focused research is needed to minimise the impact of MERS, basing control strategies on evidence gleaned from specifically addressing relevant unknowns.\n",

The definitive origin, exact mechanism of transmission, and the reason behind seasonal variability are still unclear. Although most cases have been described in countries of the Arabian Peninsula, the increasing travel to the region and the Hajj season in KSA pose a threat of a potential global pandemic. Extensive efforts are required to speed up the development of an effective therapy and vaccine. Repurposing of currently available pharmaceutical agents is highly desirable for a more rapid drug development. Meanwhile, HCWs who encounter patients with respiratory symptoms who have lived or traveled to areas with MERS-CoV should have a low threshold to consider a diagnosis of MERS-CoV, with testing and immediate implementation of proper infection control practices to prevent further spread. Finally, given the important role that camels may play in transmission of the virus, the common practices in the Arabian Peninsula of herding and consuming unpasteurized camels' milk should be discouraged until conclusive evidence is obtained that such practices do not contribute to infection.\n",

The US Department of Defense (US DoD) has funded threat reduction programs to eliminate biological weapons, secure material in repositories that could be targeted for theft, and enhance surveillance systems to monitor infectious disease outbreaks that would affect national security. The cooperative biological research (CBR) program of the US DoD's Biological Threat Reduction Program has provided financing, mentorship, infrastructure, and biologic research support to Kazakhstani scientists and research institutes since 2005. The objective of this paper is to provide a historical perspective for the CBR involvement in Kazakhstan, including project chronology, successes and challenges to allow lessons learned to be applied to future CBR endeavors. A project compendium from open source data and interviews with partner country Kazakhstani participants, project collaborators, and stakeholders was developed utilizing studies from 2004 to the present. An earlier project map was used as a basis to determine project linkages and continuations during the evolution of the CBR program. It was determined that consistent and effective networking increases the chances to collaborate especially for competitive funding opportunities. Overall, the CBR program has increased scientific capabilities in Kazakhstan while reducing their risk of biological threats. However, there is still need for increased scientific transparency and an overall strategy to develop a capability-based model to better enhance and sustain future research.

      "\tThe results of the present study found signifi cant decreases of procalcitonin, presepsin and IL-6 resulting from 3 days of immunoglobulin administration, but evidence is still limited and this needs to be confi rmed in larger studies. Introduction Presepsin (sCD14-ST) serves as a mediator of the response to infectious agents. First evidence suggested that presepsin may be utilized as a sepsis marker. Methods Presepsin was determined at presentation (T0), after 8, 24 and 72 hours in 123 individuals admitted with signs of SIRS and/ or infection. Primary endpoint was death within 30 days. Presepsin was determined using the POC assay PATHFAST Presepsin (Mitsubishi Chemical, Japan). Results Mean presepsin concentrations of the patient group at presentation and of the control group were 1,945 and 130 pg/ml, respectively (P <0.0001). Baseline presepsin diff ered highly signifi cant between patients with SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. Twenty-four patients died during 30 days. The 30-day mortality was 19.5% in total, ranging from 10 to 32% between the fi rst and the fourth quartile of presepsin concentration. Nonsurvivors showed high presepsin values with increasing tendency during the course of the disease while in surviving patients this tendency was decreasing. See Table 1 . Conclusion Presepsin demonstrated a strong relationship with disease severity and outcome. Presepsin provided reliable discrimination between SIRS and sepsis as well as prognosis and early prediction of 30day mortality already at admission. Presepsin showed close association with the course of the disease. Introduction Whether the infl ammatory biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) provides prognostic information across clinical settings and diff erent acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) is poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the prognostic value of admission PCT levels to predict adverse clinical outcome in a large ARI population. Methods We analyzed data from 14 trials and 4,211 ARI patients to study associations of admission PCT levels and setting specifi c treatment failure and mortality alone at 30 days. We used multivariable hierarchical logistic regression and conducted sensitivity analyses stratifi ed by clinical settings and ARI diagnoses to assess the results' consistency. Introduction The purpose of the study was to assess the prognosis value of pro-adrenomedullin (pADM), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), lactate (LT), albumin (ALB), cholesterol (CHOL), white blood cell (WBC) and severity score in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Methods A prospective, observational study in adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in a polyvalent ICU. Demographics, severity scores (APACHE II and SOFA) and all of the biomarkers were studied within 24 hours from septic shock onset. Descriptive and comparative statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software packages SPSS v. 15 Introduction Early diff erentiation of bacterial from candidal bloodstream infections (BSIs) in the presence of sepsis or septic shock is crucial because of the need for appropriate treatment initiation. Clinical data, although limited, suggest a role for procalcitonin (PCT) [1] [2] [3] . The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between the etiology of BSIs and the serum PCT levels. Our survey has shown that the e-learning initiative was welcome by the candidates. We conclude that introduction of e-learning prior to a simulation-based basic TTE course enhances candidates' satisfaction and feedback. Mild to moderate alterations of blood volume result in changes of PBV and Vd circ. However, against the traditional belief of centralisation we could show that the cardiovascular system preserves the distribution of blood between central and circulating blood volume in anaesthetised dogs. References Introduction Permissive hypotension, which results in avoidance of intravascular overpressure and thereby avoidance of platelet plug dislodgement early in the clotting mechanism, improves the results after trauma and hemorrhage. The research hypothesis is that augmentation of negative intrathoracic pressure with the use of an impedance threshold device (ITD) will improve hemodynamic parameters, without aff ecting permissive hypotension or causing hemodilution. On the other hand, aggressive resuscitation with Ringer lactate will cause hemodilution and intravascular pressures that are very high for permissive hypotension, capable of platelet plug dislodgement. Methods Twenty anesthetized Landrace/Large-White pigs (19 ± 2 kg, 10 to 15 weeks) were subjected to a fi xed hemorrhage (50% over 30 minutes). The pigs were randomly allocated into two groups (n = 10 per group). In group A, ITD was the only treatment for hypotension, while in group B, an intravenous administration of 1 l Ringer lactate was applied for treatment of hypotension. Hemodynamic parameters were continuously assessed for the fi rst 30 minutes after blood loss. Results Mean systolic arterial pressures (SAPs) 30 minutes after the intervention in each group were as follows: group A 80 ± 5 mmHg and group B 90 ± 4 mmHg. Maximum SAPs during the assessment period were: group A 89 ± 2 mmHg and group B 128 ± 5 mmHg. Mean pulse pressure was higher in the ITD group versus the fl uid resuscitation group (P <0.05). After the assessment period, mean hematocrit in group A was 24 ± 2%, while in group B it was 18 ± 1% (P <0.001). Conclusion In our study, the ITD increased SAP and pulse pressure without overcompensation. On the other hand, aggressive fl uid resuscitation led to a signifi cant increase of SAP >100 mmHg capable of clot dislodgement and in addition led to hemodilution. Introduction Measurement of global end-diastolic volume (GEDV) is provided by cardiovascular monitoring devices using thermodilution procedures. The aim of this study was to assess the relation between this clinically available index and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), which is typically not available at the patient bedside. Methods Measurements were performed on six anaesthetised and mechanically ventilated pigs. Volume loading via successive infusions of saline solution was fi rst performed and was followed by dobutamine infusion. These two procedures provided a wide range of LVEDV values. During these experiments, GEDV was intermittently measured using the PiCCO monitor (Pulsion AG, Germany) during thermodilutions and LVEDV was continuously measured using an admittance catheter (Transonic, NY, USA) inserted in the left ventricle. The results show that GEDV and LVEDV are generally well correlated, but the correlation coeffi cients are subject specifi c. A preliminary calibration step (for instance using echocardiography) is thus necessary to infer LVEDV from GEDV. The transpulmonary thermodilution GEDV is a better indicator of cardiac preload than SVV in patients with septic shock. Introduction Dynamic parameters are becoming standard for fl uid responsiveness assessment. Cutoff values are diff erent in the literature. The aim was to assess the accuracy of diff erent preload parameters to predict fl uid responsiveness using pulse power analysis and to compare diff erent levels of hemodynamic response due to passive leg raising (PLR) against the eff ect of a fl uid challenge (FC). Methods A prospective study in a 17-bed mixed ICU. Patients were fully ventilated and CO monitored with LiDCOplus® and underwent a FC due to hypotension and/or hypoperfusion and preload dependence (SVV and/or PPV >10%). PLR was performed before FC. Hemodynamic data were recorded prePLR, postPLR and postFC with 0.5 l crystalloids. We compared diff erent cutoff values of increase in CO and SV (10 to 15%) to assess the ability of PLR, SVV, PPV and CVP to predict the response to FC. Statistical analysis: continuous variables expressed as mean ± SD. Comparison before and after was done using a paired Student's t test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated by varying the discriminating threshold of each variable. Results Thirty-one patients were included. Baseline parameters: MAP 70.5 mmHg (SD 13.3) 87% under catecholamine, SV 55.32 ml (SD 20.2), CO 5.2 l (SD 2), SVV 16.8% (SD 12), PPV 19.1% (SD 14), HR 96 bpm (SD 18) and CVP 9.2 mmHg (SD 2.5). In total, 41.9% of patients increased 15% CO after FC (selected as responders), 38.7% after the PLR. Diff erences in responders versus nonresponder patients were: baseline SVV (23.9 vs. 11.6; P = 0.02) and PPV (28.4 vs. 12.4; P = 0.01). Diff erences in SV and CO were not statistically signifi cant. The best parameter to predict positive response to FC was PLR with cutoff 12.6% for CO increase: sensitivity 84.6% (95% CI = 65 to 104), specifi city 94.4% (95% CI = 84 to 105) and AU ROC 0.94 (95% CI = 0.86 to 1.0). ROC was also good for SVV 0.835 (95% CI = 0.66 to 1.0; P = 0.002) and PPV 0.833 (95% CI = 0.681 to 0.985; P = 0.002) in this cutoff value. In SV increase, PLR, SVV and PPV had P <0.05, but with worse ROC. In addition, SVV <13% identifi ed patients who will not increase MAP with FC: sensitivity 91.7% (95% CI = 76 to 107.3%), negative predictive value 93.5 (95% CI = 80.7 to 106). CVP failed to distinguish responders from nonresponders. Conclusion Our results support the idea that a reversible FC (PLR; CO cutoff 12.6%) is best at identifying responder patients to a FC. Dynamic parameters (SVV/PPV) are also eff ective when appropriate. Beat-tobeat SV and CO using pulse power analysis is a valid tool for these tests. Introduction Prediction of fl uid responsiveness is defi ned by an increase in stroke volume (SV) of at least 10% after volume expansion. Dynamic [1] and static [2] esophageal Doppler (OD) parameters have been proposed in mechanically ventilated children to guide fl uid therapy. This study aimed to compare dynamic parameters using the respiratory variation in aortic blood fl ow with static parameters using Doppler corrected fl ow times (FTc) obtained by OD. Methods A prospective, observational and interventional study was conducted in our pediatric ICU from March 2012 to September 2014. We investigated 18 mechanically ventilated children with acute circulatory failure (ACF) -tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria, delayed capillary refi lling or hemodynamic instability despite vasopressor drugs -using OD for each patient. Intervention: standardized volume expansion (VE). The minimum volume required to perform an eff ective fl uid challenge is 4 ml/kg infused in 5 minutes. However, only 30% of the variation of change in Pmsf can be explained by the dose of i.v. fl uid given. The proportion of responders increases with the volume of fl uids. Critical Care 2015, Volume 19 Suppl 1 http://ccforum.com/supplements/19/S1 injury (AKI) develops, positive fl uid balance has been described as a risk factor for overall mortality and delayed renal recovery. We hypothesized that fl uid overload may be an independent risk factor for AKI in the critically ill. Methods In a cross-sectional design, we collected data on consecutive, critically ill, adult patients admitted over a 5-month period to the medical and surgical ICUs of a single center. AKI was defi ned according to the RIFLE Classifi cation. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictive ability of variables for AKI. Conclusion Positive fl uid balance after cardiac surgery is an independent risk factor for mortality and for acute kidney injury in patients presenting vasoplegic shock. Conclusion Postsurgical complications have a signifi cant impact on hospital margins. Enhanced Recovery Programs have the potential not only to improve quality of care but also to improve hospital margins. References were categorized into clinical meaningful categories: 0 to 2 mmol/l (normal), 2 to 4 mmol/l (elevated) and ≥4 mmol/l (high) to allow for nonlinear eff ects. The unadjusted association between lactate group and length of stay was assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis test and post hoc Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. To assess the association between postoperative lactate levels and hospital length of stay we performed multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance estimates. We adjusted for more than 30 variables including patient demographics, comorbidities, cardiac characteristics (for example, New York Heart Association class and ejection fraction), and surgical characteristics (for example, year, status (elective, urgent, emergent), type of procedure, perfusion time, and cross clamp time). The head is still the most frequently and severely injured region. The severity of injuries increases in the most rigid part of the car. Improving VRUs' safety devices (active and passive) to reduce impact speed and severity of the primary impact has to be the next step. Introduction Various DAMPS, alarmins are released after trauma. The soluble receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (sRAGE) was reported to be associated with acute renal failure and duration of ventilation [1] . Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been associated with prognosis in trauma patients [2] . We studied the kinetics of these two biomarkers over the fi rst 5 days, in a cohort of severely ill trauma patients. Methods Patients who had sustained serious traumatic injury, within 24 hours of trauma, were recruited in a level I trauma center. We collected ISS, baseline demographic characteristics, resuscitation information and daily organ dysfunction (MOD) scores, over 10 days. Blood samples were collected within 24 hours of trauma (day 0) and on days 1, 3 and 5. sRAGE was measured by ELISA and cfDNA was measured by UV absorbance after plasma isolation. We collect data about patient characteristics, injury profi les, neurological fi ndings, results of radiological examinations, and medical courses. We then analyze the sensitivity and specifi city of MR-CDR for detecting intramedullary lesions on MRI and conduct further analysis. Conclusion Using a curved dilator and the TWG technique for the thoracic drainage procedure we found statistically signifi cant advantage to the TWG technique in comparison with the CS technique regarding precise chest tube placement within the pleural cavity. In this setting, current practice is evidently inadequate to identify and prevent blood transfusion reactions. The survey revealed high confi dence but patchy knowledge amongst nurses of the requirements for safe blood transfusion. Better timing to transfuse at times when nursing staff numbers are higher, alongside compulsory training, may together represent potential low-cost interventions to improve blood transfusion safety. Introduction During early sepsis, activation of the infl ammatory response and coagulation occurs. Extracorporeal therapies are used to adsorb mediators, but the coagulation of fi lters is a drawback [1, 2] . The aim of this study is to evaluate whether thromboelastography (TEG) may detect hypercoagulation and may improve anticoagulation during extracorporeal treatments. Methods Twenty-four patients with early severe sepsis had a TEG monitoring at basal time (T0) and during three diff erent extracorporeal treatments (T1): coupled plasma fi ltration (CPFA) with heparin infusion (Group A), CPFA with citrate infusion (Group B) and RRT with oXiris fi lter -heparin coated -and no heparin infusion (Group C). ANOVA test was used for the statistical analysis. Not the transition to hyperglycemia, but insuffi cient recovery from hypoglycemia is associated with an increased ICU mortality in patients under moderately strict or strict glucose control with insulin. Introduction The purpose of this study was to compare a computer protocol against a paper protocol in managing three domains of glucose control. Hyperglycemia is common in critically ill patients, and their risk of death is associated with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and glucose variability. A safe and eff ective insulin protocol must minimize hyperglycemia and glucose variability while also avoiding hypoglycemia. Computer-based insulin protocols promise better performance by adjusting to each individual's sensitivity to insulin. Methods This is a historical cohort study with 759 patients admitted to three ICUs (medical/cardiac, trauma, and neuroscience) at an academic tertiary care hospital. All adult patients from January 2012 to October 2013 on one of two continuous insulin protocols for at least 8 hours were included. At the start of the study period the paper protocol in use (Adult ICU) had a target glucose of 140 to 180 mg/dl and was used for any patient with a glucose higher than 180 mg/dl. In June 2013 this was replaced by a computer-based insulin protocol (EndoTool) that had the same criteria for initiation and had a target glucose of 150 mg/dl. The primary exposure was the insulin protocol, and the primary outcome was performance in maintaining glucose control. Results The median glucose in the EndoTool group (141.5 mg/dl) was lower than in the Adult ICU group (159.9 mg/dl) (P <0.0001). The standard deviation of glucose in the EndoTool group (32.3 mg/ dl) was lower than the Adult ICU group (39.5 mg/dl) (P = 0.0001). The proportion of patients in each group with 10% or higher of measurements at a severe hyperglycemia level (≥200 mg/dl) in the EndoTool group (35.2%) was lower than the Adult ICU group (64.1%) (P <0.0001). The proportion of patients who had at least one moderate hypoglycemic measurement (<70 mg/dl) was not signifi cantly diff erent between the EndoTool group versus the Adult ICU group (11.73% vs. 9.3%, respectively; P = 0.34). However, there was a higher overall incidence of hypoglycemia in the EndoTool group (5.65 hypoglycemic measurements/100 person-protocol days) compared with the Adult ICU group (3.43/100 person-protocol days) (RR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.09 to 2.45, P = 0.014). Severe hypoglycemia (<40 mg/dl) was rare, only occurring in 1/179 (0.56%) in the EndoTool group and 4/580 (0.69%) in the Adult ICU group. Conclusion Patients on the computer protocol had a lower median glucose, less variability, and less hyperglycemia than patients on the paper protocol. There was a higher risk of moderate but not severe hypoglycemia in the computer group. glucose data prove in such routine use?' Using actual case data, we have shown how comparing the mean absolute relative diff erence (MARD) and integration of the area under the curve (AUC) from the continuous glucose monitoring and intermittent measurement can be used to measure patient risk. Methods The analysis used aggregated case data generated from our recent clinical trials, where a GlySure sterile, single-use sensor and dedicated monitoring system was used to measure the blood glucose concentration in patients continuously and in real time. The measurement of risk was compared using the MARD, an accepted error calculation tool, and the AUC was calculated using an AUC analysis software program. Results When MARD from the GlySure sensor and intermittent measurement using the hospital's existing protocol was compared, the measure of risk to the patient (that is, the uncertainty regarding the patient's absolute blood glucose status) for the GlySure sensor was 50.5% lower than the intermittent measurement. The results also showed that as the variability of the BG data increases, the benefi t of continuous monitoring increases by signifi cantly reducing patient risk. The continuous monitoring reduces the patient's risk by 88%, 73%, and 69% respectively in high, medium and low variability situations. Conclusion It is more and more evident that continuous glucose technology will be instrumental in driving safe and eff ective glucose management protocols that will support more consistent glycemic management standards within ICUs and across institutions. References Introduction There is a need for continuous glucose monitoring in critically ill patients. The objective of this trial was to determine the point accuracy and reliability of a device designed for continuous monitoring of interstitial glucose levels in ICU patients (Sentrino; Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge, CA, USA). Methods Critically ill patients with an anticipated life expectancy >96 hours were eligible for participation, if the platelet count was >30 × 10 12 ml. Device readings were compared with glucose measurements in arterial blood using blood gas analyzers (RapidLab Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, The Hague, the Netherlands). We used a linear mixed model to determine which factors aff ect point accuracy. In addition, we determined the reliability, including duration of device start-up and calibration, skips in data acquisition, and premature disconnections of sensors. Results We included 50 patients, aged 65 (56 to 72) years with an APACHE II score of 23 (17 to 26). Admission types were medical (62%), elective surgery (22%) and emergency surgery (16%), and 22% had diabetes. For the accuracy analyses we had 929 comparative samples from 100 sensors in 45 patients (11 (7 to 28) samples per patient) during 4,639 hours (46 (27 to 134) hours per patient and 46 (21 to 69) hours per sensor). The Bland-Altman plot showed a bias of -0.6 mg/dl with limit of agreement between -57.2 and 56 mg/dl. Glucose prediction error analysis showed 60% of the glucose values <75 mg/dl within ±15 mg/dl and 75.8% of the glucose values ≥75 mg/dl within 20% of the comparative RapidLab results. Clarke error grid analysis showed 75.3% in zones A and 23.5% of the paired measurements in zones B, 0.3% of the paired measurements in zones C and 0.9% of the paired measurements in zones D. Point accuracy did not meet the ISO14971 standard for dosing accuracy, but improved with increasing numbers of calibrations, and was better in patients who did not have diabetes mellitus. Sixty out of 105 sensors were removed prematurely for a variety of reasons. The device start-up time was 49 (43 to 58) minutes. In the present study, it was observed that the seroprevalences of HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV were not higher than in our city population. However, taking the safety precautions of the healthcare workers during surgical or invasive procedures such as catheterization, intubation or tracheostomy without any information about the serological test results of the patients will reduce the contamination of these agents. We found that there is poor management of nutrition in the CCU. This is paired with limited knowledge and low confi dence in management amongst the attending staff . Evidence would suggest that the development and dissemination of clear hospital guidelines could improve rates of correct management [2] . However, the lack of uniform guidance based on strong evidence from the leading global authorities on nutrition suggests that, in order to improve implementation of adequate nutrition, more research is urgently required. The evidence for the effi cacy of nonpharmacological interventions to reduce short-term or long-term stress in intensive care patients was of low to moderate quality. Studies included mainly shortterm and medium-term follow-up. This highlights the need for largerscale, better-quality RCTs with longer-term outcome measurement. However, the results indicate that nonpharmacological, including psychological, approaches are likely to be benefi cial for reducing shortterm or long-term stress in intensive care patients. Introduction Patients recovering from critical illness suff er many physical and psychological problems during their recovery, including muscle weakness, fatigue, signs and symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression [1] . At present, specialist intensive care follow-up and rehabilitation is inconsistent and in many geographical areas is nonexistent. As a result, many survivors of critical illness will require using existing community rehabilitation services [2] . The aim of this present service evaluation was to understand the utilisation of community rehabilitation services by critical care survivors. Methods A database of acute referrals to community rehabilitation services was retrospectively analysed from 1 May 2014 to 31 October 2014. Age, referring specialty and reason for referral for rehabilitation were documented. This database was cross-checked with the critical care database in Glasgow Royal Infi rmary to identify which individuals had been admitted to critical care during their admission. Results Over this 6-month period 769 patients were referred from their parent specialty for community rehabilitation in North East Glasgow. Thirty-three of the 769 patients (4.3%) referred had a critical care stay during their admission. Of these, eight patients were referred for rehabilitation by orthopaedics, eight by medicine for the older patients, 11 from acute medicine and the remaining six from other specialties. Six of the 769 patients who had a critical care admission were of working age (<1%). Two individuals were admitted to critical care following trauma whilst four had complex social needs prior to their critical care admission. This included an individual with a high body mass index. None of the individuals of working age were referred as a consequence of their critical care stay. Conclusion This service evaluation demonstrates that very few critical care survivors are referred to community rehabilitation services, particularly those of working age. More work is required to understand optimal rehabilitation pathways in this patient group. Brazil. The early mobilization protocol consists of fi ve phases: 1passive exercises for the unconscious patient; 2 -active exercises associated with respiratory exercises (patient lying on the bed); 3phase 2 exercises with the patient sitting on the bed; 4 -phase 2 exercises with the patient sitting on a chair or in a standing position; 5 -phase 4 exercises plus walking. All hospital records from patients, between September 2013 and August 2014, were included in this study. Data extracted from hospital records were: age, gender, diagnosis (arrhythmia, coronariopathies, congestive heart failure and other pathologies), length of stay, number of discharge and number in each phase of the early mobilization protocol. Pearson chi-square test was used to compare the number of mobilizations (phase 4 and 5) per group of diagnoses. Odds ratios were calculated for those comparisons found to be statistically signifi cant (P <0.05). Results A total of 697 hospitals records were analyzed. Patients had on average (SD) 67.8 (13.1) years and the majority of them were males (57%). Our results revealed that 65% of patients in the CICU received phase 4 and 43% of patients in the CICU received phase 5 of the early mobilization protocol. No diff erences in the proportion of patients receiving phase 4 or 5 were found among arrhythmia, coronariopathies and congestive heart failure groups. The only diff erence found was between congestive heart failure group and other cardiovascular pathologies (P <0.001). The congestive heart failure group was mobilized 5.6 times (95% CI: 2.7 to 11.5) and 3.2 times (95% CI: 1.7 to 5.7) more than the other cardiovascular pathologies group in phase 4 and 5, respectively. Conclusion A considerable proportion of patients was mobilized without any serious complications in the CICU. Our fi ndings suggest that patients diagnosed with arrhythmia, coronariopathies and congestive heart failure can be equally mobilized in an ICU. Introduction Various therapeutic interventions needed in critical care may refl ect a high risk of death. We evaluated associations between commonly used interventions and hospital mortality in Finnish ICU patients. Methods We retrieved data on adult patients treated in Finnish ICUs between 2003 and 2013 from the Finnish Intensive Care Consortium database. We used the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS-76) for categorizing ICU interventions and the Simplifi ed Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) for quantifying severity of illness. We excluded readmissions, patients with missing outcome, SAPS II and TISS data. We also excluded very common interventions (arterial line, bolus intravenous medication), very rare ones (prevalence <1%), and interventions only applicable in specifi c populations (intracranial pressure monitoring, intra-aortic balloon assist). We grouped several TISS categories when applicable. We performed a backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis with TISS items to assess the impact of each intervention on hospital mortality (expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confi dence intervals (CIs)). Age, admission type, and SAPS score (minus age and admission type scores) were adjusted for in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion In this large retrospective multicenter study, the TISS item associated with the highest risk of death was cardiac arrest and/or countershock. Unexpectedly, the independent eff ect of emergency admission was of comparable magnitude in terms of impact on hospital mortality. Of these, in-ICU cardiac arrest might be amenable to preventive measures and should be studied further.\n",

      "\tPatients with recurrent meningitis were younger, with less immunosuppression conditions and had a better survival versus those with non-recurrent meningitis. Mortality of PM was associated with immunosuppression and impaired consciousness, but the small number of deaths in the recurrent group did not allow us to analyses the differences between the two groups. The disease is very contagious and was considered a childhood infection but now it has been identified also in adults. Consent Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this Case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor of this journal. Background Primo-infection with varicella zoster virus causes varicella, one of the most frequent pathologies in the first stage of childhood and not only. The complications of this disease may vary from pyogenic infections to pneumonia and neurological (cerebellar) lesions. Within the last years in medical practice other complications of extreme gravity of varicella emerged: cellulitis, compartment syndrome, sepsis of various etiologies (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Gram negative germs, etc.) Performant modern apparel certainly contributes to establishing the bacteriologic diagnosis and implicitly the antibiogram which led to an optimal therapeutical behavior. From experience, we consider that the varicella zoster virus is more virulent, being able to cause severe forms or complication in certain patients categories. Consent Written informed consent was obtained from the parents for publication of this Case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor of this journal. In our study the prevalence of anaerobic PJI was 5.3 %, a prevalence similar to the one cited in the literature but this prevalence may be higher. Anaerobic bacteria are slow growing organisms and they require special conditions to grow, thus the number of false negative results can be significant. Background Streptococcus pneumoniae, along with Neisseria meningitidis, represent two of the most frequent causes of bacterial meningitis in adolescents and young adults. Delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment of this condition may result in serious complications such as brain damage, hearing loss or even death. Case report We present the case of a 37 year old female, without any known medical condition, under no current medication, who was admitted in our clinic for fever, chills, fronto-occipital headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, symptoms which had been present for the last 36 hours with progressive enhancement. Upon physical examination she was febrile (38.3°C), sweating, no pulmonary crackles or cardiac murmurs, her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and pulse rate was 74 bpm, without hepatosplenomegaly, oriented to time and place but with signs of meningeal irritation (Kernig's sign, Brudzinski's sign, and nuchal rigidity). Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, biological inflammatory syndrome, electrolyte imbalance, positive procalcitonin, negative HIV, HTLV serology, negative markers of viral hepatitis B or C, normal urinalysis, negative hemocultures, and sinus X-ray showed bilateral maxillary sinusitis. Lumbar puncture at the moment showed no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) modification: normal pressure, clear appearance, negative Pandy's reaction, 1 cell/μL, protein -31 mg/dL, glucose -57 mg/dL, chloride -700 mg/dL, negative CSF cultures. PCR using mass spectrometry (PLEX -ID) performed from CSF identified Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast showed minimal meningeal enhancement, with no other modifications. Given all this data (clinical appearance and identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae in CSF using PLEX-ID), we considered the case as bacterial meningitis at an early stage, with normal CSF. She received treatment with meropenem 2 g q8h, vancomycin 1 g q12h and dexamethasone for 14 days with very good clinical response. The lumbar puncture repeated after 10 days showed no change from the previous examination. The patient fully recovered with no sequelae. Conclusions Bacterial meningitis exhibiting apparently normal CSF parameters, even if uncommon, is a very well-recognized phenomenon. A lumbar puncture which shows no abnormalities in CSF cannot exclude bacterial meningitis in the early stage of the disease. Empiric antibiotic should be used when the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is strongly suspected even in the cases with normal CSF results. PCR technique represents a great tool in establishing the causative pathogen of meningitis, making possible the diagnosis of this condition even in the early stages when no changes in the CSF are noticeable. Mycoplasma pneumoniae should be considered in all cases with fever and respiratory symptoms evolving unfavorably treated with betalactamine and associates MEP. Background In children, bacterial sepsis is a not a very common condition but it is often accompanied by severe complications that can leave sequelae. Sometimes it can be life-threatening and requires a complex and quickly set treatment. Sepsis is more common in immunosuppressed patients. Streptococcus suis could be miss-identified as other species of streptococci, thus in the settings that lack resources to routinely speciate α-hemolytic streptococci and where (undercooked) pork is a basic diet, underdiagnosis of Streptococcus suis infection is likely. Hearing loss, although is not a complication related to Streptococcus suis meningitis, is frequently reported. The percentage of KP strains isolated from blood increased between 2010 and 2015. We didn't find statistically significant changes of the resistance rates of KP to all the classes of tested antimicrobials. The presence of carbapenem resistance among the isolates from 2015 could be a major problem for the public health and hospital-acquired infections control. Our data regarding the proportion of resistant bloodstream KP strains are different from those reported by EARS-Net. We found lower and decreasing resistance rates to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, third generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and combined resistance. Still, with Romania occupying one of the first places in Europe regarding KP isolated from invasive infections resistance to antibiotics, further monitoring is mandatory and efforts should be made in order to control this problem. Background Staphylococcus aureus has a high incidence in human infectious pathology, registering severe infections caused by antibiotic-resistant strains. In Romania, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounts to up to 53.8 % of S. aureus strains isolated from blood cultures (EARS-Net report 2012). In many European countries, the percentage of MRSA invasive infections caused by S. aureus decreased below 25 % through the implementation of programs designed to limit bacterial resistance. Objectives: to determine the antibiotics resistance of S. aureus strains isolated from blood cultures. This study showed that bla CTX-M are the most prevalent resistance genes in ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Quebec City and are part of groups 1 and 9. This is consistent with global data showing the predominance of the CTX-M ESBL worldwide and with recent epidemiological data, in other regions in Canada, showing that CTX-M-15 as well as CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-9, being respectively part of groups 1 and 9, are most commonly found. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental trial conducted in Romania with combined therapy antibiotics and bacteriophages since 1975, which proved the safety of bacteriophages in clinical settings. We consider this study the cornerstone for future research regarding in vivo phage therapy in Romania. Oxacillin resistance incidence in Staphylococcus aureus has registered a slight decrease, since 2011, from 55.7 % to 44.8 % in 2015. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are significantly more resistant than Staphylococcus aureus. In 2012 the firsts strains of Enterococcus faecium resistant to vancomycin were isolated and in 2014 their proportion reached 35.0 %. Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance is highly needed, in particular to guide an efficient empirical therapy. Healthcare-associated meningitis or ventriculitis remains challenging in terms of diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Background In a medical world in which infections are caused by bacteria with increased virulence, nosocomial infection is a serious threat for all medical departments. Epidemiological data must be thoroughly collected and interpreted in the setting of clinical facts, thus guiding the complex process of therapeutic intervention. Most of the patients admitted to our clinic over a period of 6 months were infected with multi-resistant bacteria at the time of admission thus emphasizing the spread of germs with high antibiotic resistance in the community and the necessity of a thorough bacteriological survey at the time of inter-hospital transfer. Nosocomial infections remain a constant threat whose dynamics must be closely monitored in the future. The use of directly acting antiviral agents in chronic HCV hepatitis has proved to be efficient and safe in clinical trials. Methods Transaminases, bilirubin, blood cell count at initiation, 2, 4, 8, 12 weeks of treatment were evaluated in 124 patients with HCV associated cirrhosis, undergoing treatment with dasabuvir (Exviera™), ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir (Viekirax™) and ribavirin. HVC-RNA was determined at initiation and at end of therapy (EOT). Therapy with Exviera™/Viekirax™/ribavirin is well tolerated, safe and efficient in patients with chronic HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis. Ribavirin dose reductions should not be a milestone in therapy. Background At the Clinical Hospital for Infectious Diseases, a study has been performed to evaluate antiviral and hepatoprotective effects of the medicinal product Viusid in treatment of viral hepatitis B and C. The treatment of both patient groups with Viusid showed that the clinical and biochemical improvement that was more apparent in Group I, which indicates the protective effect of the medicinal product Viusid; the reduction of HBV DNA level by 50 % and HCV RNA level by 40 %, denotes an antiviral effect of the drug. Hyperbilirubinemia in patients with compensated cirrhosis treated with OPrD-ribavirin regimen represents a severe side effect. Ribavirin must be discontinued in this situation and sometimes all DAA regimen has to be withdrawn. The most important risk factors for this side effect are: Child-Pugh score at baseline 6 and platelet count at baseline below 100000/cmm. The OPrD-Riba regimen was highly efficient in difficult to treat patients with compensated cirrhosis. All the patients that have completed the therapy achieved undetectable viral load and furthermore, in the case of those who completed the 12 weeks period of follow-up, SVR 12 was achieved. The efficacy of OPrD regimen in patients with HCV compensated cirrhosis is similar with or without ribavirin. Because sometimes the ribavirin side effects can conduct to a prematurely discontinuation of all antiviral regimen, we thought that in difficult to treat patients, the regimen without ribavirin could be a better option. Liver decompensation in patients with Child Pugh score A during OPrD-ribavirin regimen has a low rate of probability, but this situation is possible. The diagnosis of compensated cirrhosis probably has to take into account more clinical and biological parameters, not only the ones used by Child Pugh score. The most important side effect was anemia which was correlated with ribavirin use and for some cases ribavirin discontinuation was necessary. Jaundice was another side effect more difficult to control. Complete therapy discontinuations due to adverse events were infrequent. The fibrosis cannot be always correctly determined by FibroMax; it is important to use other alternative test for an accurate diagnosis of cirrhosis. Moreover, even the tests manufacturer from BioPredictive recommends that a fibrotest score with a value more than 0.60 can be interpreted as severe fibrosis and must be treated urgently. The most frequent hematological side effect during OPrD-riba therapy for HCV hepatitis was anemia with recovery after adjusting the ribavirin dosage. Sometimes, the discontinuation of ribavirin was necessary, without impact in efficacy of this regimen. In terms of platelet count a significant improvement was shown. The prevalence of risk factors, behaviors and knowledge on HBV and HCV infection varies in different areas of the world. We have performed a study to determine whether classical risk factors for HBV or HCV showed diversity due to different ethnic or geographic origins in two matched young cohorts: a heterogeneous study group of international medical students, and a control group from the general Romanian population. The worldwide prevalence of certain risk factors for HBV and HCV infection is a serious issue that transcends nationality, gender, ethnic origin or educational level. Our results suggest that a global strategy for prevention and control of hepatitis infection is needed, along with effective vaccination programs. Background Data on hepatitis C virus reactivation (HCV-R) in patients with hematological malignancies (HM) under immunosuppressive therapy are limited. The prevalence of HCV infection is higher in Romania than in other EU countries. We aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics and outcome of HCV-R in patients with HM undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. One third of our patients had HCV-R. HCV can cause fulminant hepatic failure in patients with HM. Close monitoring of HCV-RNA every 3 months should be performed. Although the overall prevalence of risk factors in the general population in Romania appears to be low or under-declared, we have identified certain high-risk groups, which cumulate a large number of risk factors and have high likelihood of acquiring HBV, HCV or HIV infection. We propose priority targeting of these special population groups though information campaigns and risk reduction interventions. Case report A 42 yo patient recently hospitalized in the Râmnicu Vâlcea Hospital for jaundice with immunoglobulin M antibodies against hepatitis A detected in blood is hospitalized in our institute for supervision and the continuation of the treatment. Recent medical history shows the onset of the symptoms 11 days before with fever, jaundice and the patient recognizes contact with a person with confirmed infection with hepatitis A. As a development of the disease, the patient became comatose (GCS 3), with severe respiratory acidosis, depending on advanced respiratory support. After 24 hours, he becomes conscious, but shows limp quadriplegia, facial asymmetry, thenar and hypothenar eminence atrophy, abolished tendinous reflexes and preserved sensitivity. The MRI reveals no alterations that could explain the neurological deficit, the lumbar puncture is within normal limits. The patient had a favorable biological trend with the correction of coagulation disorders and improvement of sepsis markers. The second lumbar puncture showed albuminocytologic dissociation. The findings of motor nerve conduction studies showed markedly reduced amplitudes of compound muscle action potentials and suggested demyelinating polyneuropathy. Based on Guillain-Barré syndrome diagnosis, there were conducted five sessions of plasma exchange and after each of them we noticed progressive improvement of the motor deficit, including of the respiratory muscles, therefore the respiratory support was ceased after 8 days. Acute hepatitis with HAV can also trigger an immune response, therefore clinicians should consider this rare but serious possibility of Guillain-Barré syndrome following acute hepatitis A infection. Based on our results, we would recommend earlier therapy for chronic HCV infection, to ensure faster decrease of liver stiffness after treatment. Further long-term studies are needed to determine the exact pace at which liver fibrosis decreases past the point of SVR. It is estimated that about 103 million people around the world are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Due to population screening for HCV and initiation of antiviral treatment, HCV prevalence decreased in some countries. The purpose of antiviral treatment is to eradicate HCV completely and obtain sustained virologic response (SVR). The bibliographical data confirms that over 99% of patients with SVR remain HCV RNA negative 4-5 years after stopping treatment [1] . Our study shows a high rate of SVR after treatment with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir in naive as well as pre-treated patients with chronic HCV, and no significant side effects from taking these drugs. Background Thrombophilias are a group of hereditary or acquired hematological conditions which predispose to thrombotic phenomena and are triggered by molecular dysfunctions of the hemostasis proteins. The thrombophilia comorbidity in HIV-positive pregnant women has been little studied. No correlation between the incidence of thrombophilia and HIV infection stage or the duration of ARV therapy has been found. An early diagnosis, associated with specific therapy and rigorous monitoring of clinical and biological data, can contribute to a favorable evolution in patients with HIV-HBV coinfection and acute liver failure. The superposition of PML clinical and pathological diagnoses was 3/5 (60 %) and there were no pathologically confirmed cases of HIVE, with elevated levels of over-and under-diagnosis. Thus, the observed lack of correlation calls into better understanding of both illnesses. In the extended presentation we provided an up to date diagnosis algorithm for both. The majority of pregnant women with HIV-consumers of drugs (especially \"new drugs\") have little access to antenatal care, which leads to late discovery of HIV. The use of synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones by HIV pregnant women has important effects on newborns and their subsequent development which poses a challenge for the post-partum surveillance system. These women come from poor families who don't ensure them a proper support. Furthermore, due to issues associated to risky behavior it is difficult to include them in HIV screening or prevention programmes, which need to be adapted to their needs. There is some evidence that the tests used: APRI and FIB-4 have the ability to distinguish for both groups of patients (HIV and HIV/HBV) between the two classes of fibrosis (F0-1 to F ≥ 2), patients with and without advanced liver disease. Although in patients with HIV infection a low concordance was seen between non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of fibrosis, in co-infected patients it was moderate and these tests could be used as evaluation methods in their monitoring of liver injury especially when the results of these tests are concordant. The positive correlation between the serum level of LL37 and IFN ɣ or LL37 and ALT suggests a possible implication of this peptide in liver injury in HCV patients. Further studies are needed to translate the results from in vitro studies on LL37 into the clinical practice. Modern molecular biology techniques (GeneExpert) offer the possibility of early pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis and subsequent treatment in patients with HIV/AIDS. However, the advanced immunosuppression, together with non-compliance to treatment may associate an unfavorable evolution. There is a high risk behavior and HIV prevalence among IDUs. Thus there is a need for rapid introduction of interventions to address this problem. The authors consider that gangliosides expressed on the membrane of the HIV-infected cells might induce the synthesis of antiganglioside antibodies. The presence of anti-ganglioside antibodies seems to be a primary immunological event in HIV infection and might play a physiopathological role in the studied viral infection. The ability of the host to produce an early antigangliosidic response might be seen as a defense mechanism directed to the elimination of a danger signal. Background Since its discovery in 1983, HIV-1 has become the most extensively studied pathogen in history. Antiretroviral therapy has markedly improved the quality and the lifespan of people living with HIV. Despite achieving viral suppression many of the HIV infected patients may still harbor persistent low levels of inflammation that may contribute to premature aging and cardiovascular comorbidities. Our objective was to evaluate subclinical chronic inflammation in a cohort of persons living with HIV who were undergoing ART, based on persistent viral replication. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study in a cohort of Caucasian HIV-1 patients attending the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof. Dr. Matei Balș\", Bucharest, Romania. All included patients were under ART for at least 6 months. Blood samples were tested for: HIV viral load, CD4 cells count, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in all patients. We evaluated inflammatory markers comparatively between two groups: undetectable patients (with HIV viral loads below the level of detectiongroup 1) and HIV patients with persistent replication (group 2). Independent samples T-test and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test were used for assessing statistical differences between groups. Results Sixty patients with a mean age of 33.2 (±13.7 years) were included in the study -60 % were males. The mean time on ART was 80 (±47.8 months). Most patients (71.7 %) had serum HIV loads below the limit of detection (group 1). Mean CD4 counts were 522 (±272.9 cells/cmm) for the entire cohort and 565.4 (±268.3 cells/cmm) in group 1 and 414.2 (±261.2 cells/cmm) in group 2. Median CRP values were 1.79 (IQR = 4.6) mg/L in group 1, compared to 2.57 (IQR = 7.6) mg/L in patients with detectable viremia (without statistical significance, p = 0.92). Mean IL-6 values were 37.2 (±60.7) pg/mL for group 1 vs 66 (±15.5) pg/mL in group 2 (with the level of statistical significance close to the cut-off value, p = 0.06). TNF-alpha mean values were 20 (±14.4) pg/mL in detectable patients (group 2) compared to 16.6 (±17.5) pg/mL in group 2 (p = 0.48). In our cohort undergoing ART we noted similar levels of CRP and TNF-alpha for patients with persistent viral replication and undetectable viremia. The levels of IL-6 seemed to be higher in the group with detectable viremia. Background Guillain-Barré syndrome, is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy triggered by an acute infectious process. Etiopathogenetically, the condition usually follows a viral infection (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Varicella-Zoster, herpes). We present a case of acute polyradiculoneuritis, manifested by a pathological picture installed in the evolution of acute varicella (Guillain-Barré syndrome) to an immunocompetent patient. Biological rigorous clinical monitoring, along with an effective interdisciplinary collaboration in chickenpox cases with neurological complications may favorably influence the evolution of the patients. Early diagnosis of herpetic encephalitis along with specific antiviral therapy can favorably influence the evolution of the disease in immunocompetent adults with this brain disorder known with a high potential of severity.

Background Measles represent a problem in current infectious pathologies through the possibility of appearance of severe forms of measles and/or some types of patients. The absence of vaccination due to various reasons leads to spread of this disease in the receptive population and the evolution of infections (center) or small epidemics (outbreaks). Objectives: 1. The analysis of incidence of measles in the last years in Timiș County; 2. Comparison with the situation from all our country and other countries; 3. Complex analysis regarding conditions for developing severe forms or complications; 4. Concrete measures regarding the evaluation of incidence of this disease. We have identified a low prevalence of pneumococcal colonization in pediatric patients with influenza. However, when colonization was present, it associated a significantly longer hospital stay and a significantly higher number of complications, highlighting the need for close monitoring and screening for pneumococcal colonization in children. Background Varicella is a highly contagious infectious disease, frequently encountered during childhood, with general receptivity and most often, with self-limited evolution. There are cases when varicella can present severe complications, such as acute encephalitis, cerebellitis, and rarely myelitis. Often, the host has a previous immunosuppression, such complications being rare in patients with a normal immunological status. Case report We present the case of a 10 year old girl, diagnosed 7 days prior with varicella, without any significant medical history, admitted in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof. Dr. Matei Balș\" for lower back pain, myalgias, muscle weakness, difficulty in walking. The onset of the symptoms was 3 days prior with an evolution towards exacerbation. Clinical exam upon admission confirmed varicella and furthermore, urinary retention with enlarged bladder, diminished patellar, right plantar clonus, decrease in muscle strength, myalgias, and paresthesias, coordination impairment in the lower limbs and asymmetric paraparesis predominantly on the right side. Workup was within the normal range. Myelitis was suspected and therefore a MRI of the head and spine was performed, which showed medullar inflammatory lesions in the cervicothoracic segment. Lumbar puncture was normal, except for a positive varicella-zoster virus PCR from CSF. Positive diagnosis consisted of cervicothoracic varicella-zoster virus myelitis. Treatment with acyclovir (60 mg/ kg/day), ceftriaxone 2 g/day, corticotherapy with methylprednisolone, human immunoglobulin, and iv fluids was promptly instituted for 14 days, with a slow favorable evolution. Paresthesias, motor deficit, urinary retention and sensitivity impairment resolved under treatment. Although this patient had a normal immunological status, she presented a severe complication of varicella, which required antiviral and cortisone treatment in high doses for an extended period of time, which eventually led to complete recovery.

Background Enteroviruses, a group of single-stranded RNA viruses, are commonly encountered infectious agents, especially in infants and children. They are responsible for a broad array of clinical manifestations, from herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), to myocarditis, aseptic meningitis. Traditionally enterovirus infections present with benign symptoms, taking the form of uncomplicated summer illnesses; during the summer of 2016 we registered a high number of severe, life threatening, forms of manifestation which required initial PIC management, long hospital management and, in some particular case of meningoencephalitis with associated motor sequelae, kinesiotherapy and physical therapy, fact that highlighted the associated burden of these summer infections. Background Combined antiretroviral therapy significantly improved the prognosis and the life expectancy of HIV patients. Along with this, the profile of HIV associated malignant pathologies has changed. Among them, lymphoma, having a higher incidence and a poorer prognosis than in general population, is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in HIV infected people. Case report We present two cases of HIV-associated lymphoma with different outcome. In the first case, a newly HIV diagnosed patient, with a good immunological status (lymphocytes CD4 count 442/cmm, HIV-RNA = 193502 copies/mL), developed non-Hodgkin's Burkitt-type lymphoma and he had a fulminant evolution towards death. In the second case, a patient known for over twenty years with HIV infection and who had discordant immunological and virological response to antiretroviral therapy (lymphocytes CD4 count 19/cmm, undetectable HIV-RNA), was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and he had a favorable evolution with chemotherapy. Both patients presented with systemic extranodal involvement, B symptoms and were classified in stage IV lymphoma. The extranodal involvement included central nervous system and liver in the case of the patient with non-Hodgkin's Burkitt-type lymphoma and liver and spleen involvement in the case of patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Both patients required exhaustive medical investigations and a close interdisciplinary cooperation during the entire time of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Conclusions HIV-associated lymphoma manifests in various forms in clinical settings. Unlike in general population, HIV-associated lymphoma is usually more aggressive and has a poor prognostic. Therefore it must be included into the differential diagnosis panel in patients presenting with sudden increase in lymph nodes, neurological manifestation and abrupt decrease in CD4 lymphocytes count. HIV-associated lymphoma differential diagnosis involves a wide panel of infectious and oncologic pathologies, therefore extensive investigation and the implication of specialists from various medical fields are required. A fast and accurate diagnosis may warrant the future evolution of the patients.

Background Among immunocompetent hosts the enteroviral infections are most frequently benign and auto-limited illnesses. Exceptionally these summer viral pathologies can evolve dramatically, presenting under severe forms of disease, with important associated complications sometimes leading to death. In the present paper we present the clinical evolution of an acute Coxsackie virus infection in an immunocompetent child, complicated by pancytopenia. Case report A young baby girl, 11 months of age, without any particular pathologic medical history is submitted in the 9 th Pediatric Department at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof. Dr. Matei Balș\" for fever, poor feeding, sleepiness and diarrhea. The clinical onset, registered 48 hours before her hospital submission was characterized by fever and poor feeding. The initial clinical evolution found a moderately ill appearing child, with pallor identified, without associated petechiae or bruising and without any other particular exanthematous elements, with a stable cardio-circulatory status, with no clinical signs of renal function impairment, diarrheal stools emitted, no nuchal rigidity or neurological focal signs present. The laboratory investigations isolated a franc pancytopenia (NL = 1.600/cmm, Hb = 8.8 g/dL, PLT = 105.000/cmm), with no other pathological findings. The serological screening for HIV, HTLV, adenovirus, EBV, CMV, Parvovirus, Influenza came back negative, with a normal peripheral smear and bone marrow aspiration. No clinical relevant result was communicated by the microbiological laboratory (negative hemocultures, nasal and pharyngeal swabs, uroculture and stool cultures). A positive IgM serology for Coxsackie virus was obtained. Cortisone, i.v. immunoglobulin, endovenous hydration and supportive therapy were initiated, with subsequent favorable evolution, with rapid normalization of the hemogram parameters (a discrete hypochromic anemia persists at a level previously identified in the infant) and clinical restoration. The acute Coxsackie virus infection in the immunocompetent pediatric population can sometimes evolve severely, complicated by acute diarrheal manifestations with subsequent dehydration and possible hematological involvement. In evolution the presented case maintained a residual anemia (Hb = 10.8 g/dL), with no other para-clinical imbalances.

Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the liver, the overall incidence of approximately 626,000 cases annually, with predominance in males. HCC is considered the third leading cause of death from malignancy and the second leading cause of death respectively in the field of digestive cancers. These patients are 80 % previously diagnosed with hepatitis B or C. The incidence of HCC in patients diagnosed with cirrhosis of viral B and C etiology is increasing, overall survival at 5 years continues to remain below 10 % due on the one hand to the discovery of tumors in advanced stages, ineffective screening in patients with risk factors for HCC and on the other hand to the lack of curative therapies applicable to this category of patients. Curative or palliative treatment of HCC depends mainly on local tumor extension and preexisting liver disease. Angiogenic agents of the type Sorafenib may cause an increase in overall survival by 44 % compared to placebo in patients with advanced HCC. Case report We present the case of a of 47 years old male, known with cirrhosis of viral etiology B from 2003, consumer of ethanol, who refused antiviral therapy with entecavir in 2009 and was diagnosed in February 2016 with HCC with extrahepatic extension. The patient was admitted in January 2016 at the Suceava Emergency Hospital with jaundice, fever, right upper quadrant pain, loss of appetite, weight loss. Clinical exam: patient with intense jaundice, emaciated, superficial lymph impalpable, ascites fluid quantity average, slightly sensitive right upper quadrant. Laboratory findings: significant hepatic cytolysis, cholestasis, elevated amylase, alpha-fetoprotein slightly elevated, thrombocytopenia, moderate inflammatory syndrome. CT and MRI exam revealed a nodular lesion in segment VI/VII with extra capsular extension and diaphragm and chest wall invasion. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry outlined trabecular hepatocellular carcinoma developed on a background of chronic active hepatitis advanced fibrosis. The patient has no indication for liver transplantation and liver resection, but could benefit from treatment with Sorafenib. The patient devloped important ascites, right massive pleurisy, hepatic encephalopathy phenomena and died 6 months after the diagnosis of HCC and one month after starting treatment with Sorafenib. Conclusions Current medical treatments are less effective in advanced HCC, and their role after liver transplantation, liver resection, should be explored further. Current hopes are turning to new molecular \"target\" therapies that explore the biological pathways involved in carcinogenesis signaling in the liver.

Background Influenza seasons represent a major strain on the health care system and they can vary in their severity, timing and duration from one season to another. Most of patients the infected with A H1N1 influenza virus exhibit no symptoms or very mild respiratory symptoms and high fever. In some cases, regardless of age or comorbidities, severe disease and complications due to infection, including death, may occur. Our case series study is meant to analyze the epidemiological, clinical and paraclinical characteristics of patients infected with type A H1N1 Influenza virus, admitted in the Intensive Care Department of INBI \"Prof. Dr. Matei Balș\" in the 2015-2016 influenza season. Methods A retrospective, observational case series study was conducted over a 6-month period, on 21 adult patients admitted in the Intensive Care Department, that have been confirmed with severe influenza infection through nasopharyngeal swab and tracheal secretion PCR analysis. In the same time, we collected data on demographics and comorbidities. Clinical data, microbiological samples and imagistics were extracted from patients' medical charts through thorough analysis. Eventually, therapeutic measures were statistically correlated with the outcome. The incidence of severe influenza cases in the Intensive Care Department was relatively low, but the severity was high; 28.5 % of the cases might have been prevented by following the recommendation for vaccination of risk groups in Romania. Background Measles is an acute infectious disease, highly contagious; the death among infants still remains in very high proportion (about 60 %) due to bronchopneumonia. Respiratory diseases are the result of measles virus with associated bacterial infection, which may include any respiratory area, secondary lesions, both viral and immune cellular depression. Case report We present the case of a child, 11 months old, female, unvaccinated, with multiple hospitalizations for bronchiolitis in the last 3-4 months, suppurative otitis, febrile convulsion syndrome, last hospitalization at \"Louis Turcanu\" Emergency Hospital for Children Timișoara, 10 days before presentation in our clinic for: emphysematous acute bronchiolitis, otitis media with effusion. Affirmative, 2 days after discharge the patient had fever, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, cough and some eruptive elements. The child was guided to our hospital by the general physician. At admission the child presented: influenced general condition, adynamia, nasal obstruction, cough with expiratory 3-4 secuses, saburral tongue, throat congestion, erythemato-macular elements eruptive with tendency to confluence on the face and chest, liver at 2 cm below the lower edge of the costal margin. Biological tests at admission: anemia, inflammatory syndrome present. A diagnosis of measles and bronchial hyperreactivity was suspected (subsequent anti measles IgM positive). Treatment was begun with water and electrolyte rebalancing treatment, bronchodilators, corticosteroids. Antibiotics were administrated after 2 days, due to the persistence of fever (isolated febrile hooks) and positive procalcitonin. After 4 days general condition was altered with polypnea, intercostal draft, oxygen saturation 85 % without oxygen mask, requiring transfer to intensive care. Endotracheal intubation was necessary, because of desaturation episodes, highlighting this radiological image: diffuse fog of both lung fields. In an attempt to extubate, the patient presents pulmonary edema and severe bronchospasm, requiring reintubation after 4 days. After about 2 weeks the child's respiratory status degrades, evolving to acute respiratory distress syndrome with metabolic acidosis and severe episodes of bradycardia. She is mechanically ventilated, but becomes oligoanuric, bradycardia does not respond to atropine then cardiopulmonary arrest occurs. Overall measles prognosis is favorable in children with satisfying nutritional status and good living conditions. Prognosis remains poor in children under 2 years with dystrophic syndromes (anemia, rickets) and multiple comorbidities.

Background Right-sided infectious endocarditis (IE) is a common condition in IV drug users (IVDU), Staphylococcus spp. being the most involved pathogen. Many IVDU are HIV positive, condition making them extremely susceptible to infections. Our aim is to present the challenges raised by the management of IE in an HIV positive IVDU. Case report A 27-year-old former IVDU, currently under methadone substitution, with HCV chronic infection, HIV infection (naive to treatment), was admitted into the hospital for fever (38.3°C), dyspnea on minimal exertion (SaO 2 = 87 % spontaneous), cough, generalized arthromyalgia, temporal-spatial disorientation. Taking into account the HIV status correlated with the severe general presentation and important lymphopenia, the patient had inserted a left jugular central venous line (CVL) for easier administration of medication, blood cultures were taken, and he was started on maximal antimicrobial therapy associated with dexamethasone and mannitol to treat a potential meningitis (later ruled out by lumbar puncture). The drug abuse history, the continuously deteriorating state urged for a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) that revealed 3 vegetations located on the tricuspid valve, evocative for IE. Therapy was adapted for a possible staphylococcal endocarditis (vancomycin IV 2 g q12h 3 days, and gentamycin IV 200 mg single dose 2 days), with diuretic and beta-blocker drugs. A few days later one blood culture came out positive for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). The diagnosis was IE with MSSA on tricuspid valve (revised Duke criteria: 1 major criterion -vegetations seen on TTE, 3 minor criteria: predisposing factors, one positive blood culture and fever), the antibiotherapy was changed again to oxacillin IV 12 g per day (7 days). Despite the correct treatment, the patient's evolution worsened (low fever, intense dyspnea, increased biologic inflammatory syndrome, pulmonary rales), the chest radiography was consistent with pneumonia, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, tuberculosis was excluded, but MSSA was confirmed (probable septic emboli). Blood cultures were taken from the CVL, and one was positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (the new finding was interpreted as a nosocomial infection due to the patient's poor adherence to the hygienic procedure involving the CVL). Linezolid was used for 2 weeks, and then oxacillin was resumed, completing a 6 week successful antibiotherapy. An HIV positive patient, especially an IVDU, is characterized by a great susceptibility to infections, making him a challenge for the physician to diagnose and treat. Even with adequate therapy, these patients are prone to develop life-threatening complications, mainly because of poor adherence to treatment. The data presented above show us great seriousness of respiratory infections with influenza with quick development of respiratory failure, requiring advanced support through IOT + VM method, imminent help, but increasing the risk of superinfection. Extremely severe bacterial infections with multiple resistance, create great difficulties in ensuring the success of bacteriological control. To optimize this success particular material resources are needed, to cover the acquisition of highest technology and the latest equipment, as well as human resources, highly qualified and experienced practice to be able to make quick decisions, accurate and responsible multidisciplinary working groups. In the Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases, Constanța, Romania, SARI mortality was zero. The receptive population was unprotected by vaccination and mostly consisted of adults with comorbidities. AH1N1 was the most prevalent subtype in the flu in season 2015-2016. Background Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation, infections, neoplasms and autoimmune diseases. Its biological activity is exerted through two mechanisms which involve the binding of IL-6 to a specific membrane receptor, abbreviated as IL-6R (classic signaling pathway) or the binding of IL-6 to the soluble form of the receptor, abbreviated as sIL-6R (trans signaling pathway); this step is followed by the interaction between the previously formed complex and the transducer subunit (gp 130). The investigation of the intracellular signaling pathways, by which IL-6 mediates pro-and anti-inflammatory effects in viral infections, represents the aim of our prospective study. The persistence of HBsAg after the acute phase was detected in 64.4 % of cases. In 15.6 % we observed evolution towards chronicity. Evolution toward healing (seroconversion) was seen in 20 % of cases, after 12 months after the acute phase. Background Bacterial infection or colonization during pregnancy may be innocuous or may lead to significant consequences for the mother or the fetus. Early diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial treatment are essential steps towards the best possible pregnancy outcome. We have identified fairly low prevalences of cervical pathogens in a population of pregnant female patients closely monitored in a tertiary care hospital in Bucharest, Romania. Our results suggest that screening for Klebsiella should be performed earlier in pregnancy and that younger women have higher incidences of fungal infections. We identified a fairly low prevalence of GBS colonization (5.8 %) and one case of urinary GBS infection during pregnancy. Our study did not reveal major risk factors for GBS colonization or infection in this cohort of pregnant women from Southern Romania. Despite major advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease, management of these patients remains a challenge for clinicians as they do not respond or achieve only transient responses. Easy and constant access to antiretroviral therapy is essential and stem-cell transplantation should be considered but prevention programs, standardized nationally and integrated internationally, need to become a public health priority. In clinical practice, sometimes we meet cases that prove to be a real professional challenge. This bacillary meningoencephalitis raised some diagnosis issues because of the atypical onset (acute), the presence of a rough meningeal syndrome and therapy problems linked to the appearance of the hepatocytolysis syndrome.

The clinical presentation is polymorphic and nonspecific, but most often characterized by: self-limited influenza-like illness, pneumonia or hepatitis. On the other hand, there are other clinical forms, which are less frequent like: cardiovascular, neurologic, obstetric manifestations and dermatologic (5-20 %) in the form of erythema nodosum or other nonspecific exanthemas, maculopapular rash or diffuse punctiform pruritic rash. Case report We report the case of a 53 year old Caucasian female, consumer of raw milk, who presented for clinical and diagnostic reevaluation of a persistent fever. Initially, the case was diagnosed as an acute acalculous cholecystitis (cholestatic syndrome associated with hepatic cytolysis and thick gallbladder wall at CT) and treated with ertapenem and ciprofloxacin, under which the patient became afebrile, but the fever reappeared as soon as she left the hospital. At the time of admission in our clinic, the case was considered as an angiocholitis and treated initially with ampicillin/sulbactam, but after 48 h we escalated to piperacillin/ tazobactam and doxycycline and then to meropenem and doxycycline (9 days of meropenem and 5 days of doxycycline) because the patient presented relapsing fever under treatment (maximum 39°C). At day 6 of hospitalization, the patient developed erythematous, indurated nodules, not sharply marginated, with 2-3 cm in diameter, located on the anterior lower legs. Investigations were extended for finding the etiology of this new manifestation, diagnosed after the histopathologic examination as erythema nodosum. We excluded: pulmonary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, streptococcal, Yersinia, Salmonella and Mycoplasma infections, cholangiocarcinoma, genital cancer. The only positive finding was positive IgM antibodies for Coxiella burnetii. We reintroduced doxycycline, despite lack of response at the beginning of hospitalization and soon after that the fever remitted. Repeating the Coxiella serology we still found high antibodies titer and the favorable evolution of erythema nodosum under doxycycline pleaded for the diagnosis of Q fever. Moreover, it is important to mention that the patient forgot to take her treatment for 1 day, which determined the apparition of new nodules. The evolution of these new lesions was favorable, a compatible aspect of a therapeutic confirmation of the diagnosis, which confirmed once more the efficacy of our management. The case is highlighting a rare clinical form of Q fever and its particularities of evolution with a slow response to the usual therapy. At the same time our case is illustrating the differential diagnosis of persistent fever and associated erythema nodosum.

Most often it is due to inappropriate treatment with corticosteroids (steroidmodified tinea), systemic or topical, prescribed for some pre-existing pathology or given mistakenly for the treatment of misdiagnosed tinea. The inflammation and scaly, typical clinical signs of dermatophytoses, are suppressed making the diagnosis difficult. The usual sites where this problem occurs are the face, groins, lower legs, and hands. Longstanding steroid modified cases may require prolonged oral antifungal therapy. Great progress has been made in the management of ARDS. Nowadays novel agents and techniques are available, including antimicrobial drugs, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, as well as supportive treatment (advanced mechanical ventilation). It seems that only the subgroup of patients with relative mild, early ARDS are likely to benefit from non-invasive ventilation. Background Granulicatella species are nutritionally variant streptococci. They are a normal component of the oral flora, but have been associated with a variety of invasive infections in humans, especially bacterial endocarditis or abdominal abscesses. Recently, Granulicatella elegans was isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) as well. CNS involvement has to be early recognized since Granulicatella infections have an increased morbidity and mortality as well as great bacteriologic failure and relapse rates. Case report We present a case of a 53 years-old woman with meningitis, first considered to be tuberculosis (TB). She received antiTB treatment, including streptomycin. Seven days after treatment initiation, the general condition improved, but the patient experienced bilateral deafness as well as severe disequilibrium, documented by pure tone audiometry and vestibular investigations (posturography, videonystagmography and video head impulse test -HIT). These permanent sensorial deficits have a huge negative impact on quality of lifepatient cannot communicate anymore, walk alone or perform daily activities. Together with appropriate new antibiotic treatment for Granulicatella infection, hearing aid and vestibular rehabilitation program were recommended. Very few cases of Granulicatella meningitis are reported and none with hearing and equilibrium deficit secondary to this infection. We consider this case as a cochleo-vestibular bilateral deficit secondary to meningitis more than to ototoxic treatment, since in the majority of adult cases with ototoxic lesions, aminoglycosides affects only one of the sensorial structures from the inner earhearing sensory epithelium or vestibular one, but not both. Granulicatella induce invasive infections. Rapid initiation of adequate antibiotic therapy minimizes the severity of the disease as well as long-term sequels. In this case, sudden severe bilateral onset of the hearing loss limited communication and permanent hearing loss will be partially compensated by the hearing aids. Regarding bilateral vestibular deficit, rehabilitation is very difficult and long-lasting, with dramatically limitations in daily activities.

Background Chickenpox is a common childhood infectious disease, very contagious, usually benign and self-limited, and complications are believed to be rare. Clostridium difficile colitis represents an important cause of morbidity in children, with high numbers of relapses and sometimes, with a severe life threatening evolution. Fecal microbiota transplantation represents an efficient alternative therapy to Clostridium difficile colitis which is unresponsive to standard treatment. Background Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease caused by a wide variety of pathogens and may be a professional challenge. In 1901, Sir William Osler noted in the fourth edition of his book, \"The Principles and Practice of Medicine\", that pneumonia is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality of all acute diseases. More than a century later, the prominence of pneumonia did not change, the pneumonia being one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Objectives: to establish the demographic and clinical aspects, evolution and etiology of CAP. Although varicella pneumonia is the most common cause of dyspnea, myocarditis can be a complication of chickenpox that determines shortness of breath. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of this rare form of myocarditis can lead to complete recovery of the patient.

Although it is exceptionally rare now, diphtheria should not be excluded as differential diagnosis, especially given the latest Romanian epidemiological report that shows a decrease to 65 % in childhood vaccination rate and no immunization booster in adulthood. Natural therapy may at times have a harmful effect, such as the one described in the aforementioned case, or it can produce drug-drug interactions which can increase/decrease the efficacy of medical therapy. Candida stomatitis is more frequent in urban areas (463 cases/year), more than half being men (232/year) and little children. More studies are needed in order to evaluate the involvement of different Candida species in the infections. More laboratory confirmation data are needed and a very good collaboration between laboratory doctors, clinicians and epidemiologists is strictly necessary. There is an important increase in anthrax cases in south-eastern Romania, all in animal-breeders, connected with an inappropriate veterinary surveillance. Not all cutaneous forms had a rapid good evolution, one developed potential fatal complications. The anthrax meningo-encephalitis described here had an unexpected favorable outcome, probable due to the young age, good previous health, early suspicion and prompt treatment.

The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in 2014 has exerted a great pressure on healthcare systems both inside, but also outside the African continent, in the attempt to identify and manage imported cases in order to prevent further transmission. In Romania, the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof. Dr. Matei Balş\" was the designated medical facility to manage possible cases of EVD. Our study aims to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and risk perception of the Institute's healthcare workers (HCWs) regarding Ebola virus disease and the recent epidemic. Most HCWs possess significant knowledge about Ebola virus disease. During the African epidemic, they experienced a moderate degree of worry and relied mostly on information provided at the Institute. Our study reveals the importance of professional education offered to employees by medical institutions and could help improve training sessions held during public health emergency situations. Extensive masses due to abdominopelvic actinomycosis raise challenging diagnostic and therapeutic problems due to frequent confusions with malignant tumors. First-line therapy includes high doses of penicillin over a prolonged period up to 6 months. Data concerning other antibiotics or shorter courses of therapy in actinomycosis are limited. We present a case of abdominopelvic actinomycosis with a complete remission after 42 days of penicillin combined with 21 days of tigecycline, in a 42 year-old woman hospitalized in \"Matei Balș\" National Institute for Infectious Diseases between 22.02-05.04.2016, who was later followed for 12 weeks after treatment. Case report A 43 year-old woman with solitary right kidney and a 12-year history of an intrauterine device presented to the urology department of \"Sf. Ioan\" Clinical Emergency Hospital for a 2-month history of nausea, abdominal pain, 8 kg weight loss and dysuria. Imaging and laboratory investigations revealed severe anemia, obstructive renal failure, right ureterohydronephrosis and a large retroperitoneal mass of 10 cm × 9 cm × 10.4 cm involving the right ovary and uterus, invading the sigmoid, rectum, urinary bladder and compressing the right ureter. A double J stent and a urinary catheter were placed. The patient was consulted in the surgery ward for what was believed to be a metastatic ovarian carcinoma. Exploratory laparoscopy revealed dense but friable adhesions allowing only a left anexectomy with partial omentectomy and impeding a complete resection. Histological samples showed an inflammatory granulomatous tissue with multiple abscesses containing colonies of Actinomyces spp. and the patient was referred to the \"Matei Balș\" National Institute for Infectious Diseases. The patient was started on penicillin 12 million units/day for a total of 42 days. After the first 10 days of penicillin, tigecycline (100 mg/day) was added for 21 days for the treatment of concurrent urinary infection with MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to colistin and sensitive only to tigecycline and fosfomycin. The patient had a favorable clinical and biologic outcome. A CT assessment after 4 and 12 weeks revealed complete remission of the abdominopelvic mass with right ureterohydronephrosis and a few small abdominal adenopathies (<11 mm). The case highlights the favorable effect of tigecycline for 21 days associated with the standard therapy of penicillin in a case of abdominopelvic actinomycosis with a remission at 6 weeks of therapy.

Background Raoultella planticola is a gram-negative bacillus that was primarily considered as environmental bacteria, belonging to family Enterobacteriaceae and related to Klebsiella spp. R. planticola is sensitive to cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones; strains of R. planticola with resistance to almost all clinically available antibiotics except tigecycline and colistin have been reported. The reports of R. planticola infections are limited; this bacterium has been reported in cholecystitis, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, pancreatitis and pneumonia. In pediatric population vitamin D deficiency was associated with sepsis and higher PRISM-III score. In HIV-infected patients DR-TB caused was associated with previous treatment, lower median CD4 cell-count and increased in-hospital mortality. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding the TB site. The rate of MDR was greater than in HIV non-infected patients. Background Some urinary infections are considered to be triggers for interstitial nephropathies. The most frequent urinary infections are determined by bacteria, rarely by viruses or yeasts. The authors aimed to evaluate if kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) could represent a specific serological marker in patients with urinary tract infections susceptible to develop kidney dysfunction. These results sustain the idea that KIM-1 could be a prediction factor for renal dysfunction in patients with urinary infections. Increased levels of serum gangliosides in patients with BPH could be considered a defense mechanism against infections, important in maintaining a vital biological balance. Serum gangliosides could represent a useful monitoring parameter in patients with obstructive prostate benign hyperplasia and urinary infections. Background Toxocariasis is caused by a series of related nematode species that routinely infect dogs and cats throughout the world. This study is a warning on geographical regions underestimated. In the region of Moldova (Iași) toxocariasis is frequent in dogs, cats and foxes. In the presented case, the clinical and radiological findings were insufficient to allow the differentiation between tuberculous and staphylococcal etiology. Additionally, the activity of anti-staphylococcal agents such as rifampin and linezolid on Mycobacterium tuberculosis masked the clinical progression of the disease and further prolonged the time to etiological diagnosis. Bacteriological tests failed to identify the etiologic agent, and the definite diagnosis was eventually based on histopathologic examination, highlighting the importance of obtaining a tissue specimen to allow accurate diagnosis and correct interdisciplinary management.

Although type B of RSV didn't give severe clinical forms, in the case of the child aged 2.9 years, RSV type B induced a severe clinical form which resulted in death. In patients with associated chronic diseases, RSV can cause either death or serious infections. Infections like flu and infections due to RSV can spread easily in the community. Pathogenicity mechanisms for understanding this infection are needed along with more studies for genotyping and gene sequencing of RSV. Background Postoperative sepsis occurring in immunocompromised elderly patients, imposes complex clinical-therapeutic monitoring, and is known as an important cause of mortality in this population. The purpose of the paper is to present a clinical case with Acinetobacter baumannii sepsis associated with Clostridium difficile enterocolitis in an elderly immune suppressed patient. Early detection of postoperative sepsis associated with infection with C. difficile, alongside effective therapeutic clinical monitoring can help increase life expectancy in elderly immunocompromised patients. Our study identified a psychological risk profile of people living with HIV/AIDS in Romania and we concluded that every single risk factor should be addressed properly by a specialist multidisciplinary team. The WHO Experts on Influenza Antiviral Susceptibility work closely to promote understanding of the means of prevention, treatment and control of influenza virus diseases, including the emergence of antiviral resistance. Due to the high prevalence of resistance to the adamantane class of drugs among influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic strain, neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are currently the only antivirals used in treatment of respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses and less in their prevention -in Romania. Because current pharmaceutical options for treating influenza infection and the opportunity of their use in prophylaxis therapy are limited, there remains a critical need for surveillance on NAI susceptibility of influenza viruses circulating worldwide and also in Romania. The National Influenza Center of the Cantacuzino Institute performs laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza viruses, including antiviral susceptibility testing. Due to the implementation of sensitive and functional testing for antiviral susceptibility of influenza viruses circulating during the last 3 epidemic seasons, the number of samples tested in Romania has been increasing. Recorded values are in the baseline of the characteristic strains, still being sensitive to antivirals. Continuous monitoring of antiviral susceptibility is needed to allow early detection of resistant strains. Background Sepsis remains a major problem of modern medicine despite considerable medical advances in recent decades. The undeniable relevance of this condition is explained by the increasing incidence, high mortality, and high economic costs related to treatment. More than 750,000 cases of sepsis occur annually in the United States and this number has been increasing over the years, and the cost of treatment is estimated to be 17 billion USD per year. In Europe the number of sepsis cases annually recorded is approximately 500,000 cases, and according to the data reported by several authors the number of fatalities would vary between 30 % and 90 %. The most common pathogens identified in the etiology of sepsis were the species of Staphylococcus, which corresponds to some literature data.\n",

      "\tThis report describes two cases of clinical remission of DM in cats with FCGS under insulin-glargine and dietary management. Both cases had been previously treated with corticosteroids, which are considered a risk-factor for DM in cats [10] . Although the corticosteroids were discontinued, these animals required insulin therapy and a concurrent suitable diet to control the DM. While one cat started insulin therapy with insulin-glargine, the other began the treatment with lente-insulin and was later switched to insulin-glargine. Clinical remission was obtained 10 and 18 weeks after starting insulin therapy, respectively. This is in agreement with previous studies that describe a high-rate of clinical remission in feline DM managed with insulin-glargine and suitable diets [20] [21] [22] . Concurrently, these animals were presenting with FCGS, and both cases were infected with calicivirus. This disease could have lead to a more difficult management of DM. In the first case the animal went into clinical DM remission and few days later the FCGS symptoms worsened. In the second one, the FCGS was a clinical problem during insulin therapy. Despite being associated with a previous good clinical improvement and a reduction of lesions, corticosteroids were contraindicated in both cases. Therefore, based on previous clinical trials [12] , an oral protocol of rFeIFN-ω was successfully applied. In both cases, clinical improvement was gradually observed and was significantly marked (and noted by owners, who remarked that the animals started eating without discomfort and had reduced hypersalivation) around 60 days after the onset of therapy. This was particularly evident in the second case where rFeIFN-ω therapy was associated with a clinical improvement of oral lesions and a concurrent reduced insulin dose requirement which culminated in type II DM remission. This is in agreement with the previously cited work that describes an overall relief of pain in refractory cases of FCGS [12] . It is also in agreement with multiple anecdotal reports that describe a rapid improvement in well-being in cats with FCGS during oral rFeIFN-ω treatment, but with a period of three to six months being necessary in some severe cases before the lesions are fully resolved, especially where there has been regular previous use of corticosteroids (D. McGahiepersonal communication). Although there are no studies that clearly detail the immunomodulatory mechanisms of oral rFeIFN-ω use, it has been proven that oral human interferon-alpha administration may potentiate a local T-helper 1 response (Th1) [23] . In fact, human interferon-alpha seems to increase the expression of gamma-interferon, a Th1 cytokine inducer, while it reduces the Interleukin-4 production, responsible for a T-helper 2 response [23] . Recognizing that the Th1 response is an important immunological pathway against viral infections [23] , it seems reasonable that rFeIFN-ω and human interferon-alpha (both type I interferons) may have a similar local action. Therefore, this Th1enhancement may explain the clinical improvement observed in these calicivirus positive cats during rFeIFN-ω therapy. Further controlled prospective studies are needed to reinforce these clinical findings, correlating them with the local immune response. These two clinical cases describe the successful use of oral rFeIFN-ω in diabetic cats with FCGS as an appropriate alternative to corticosteroid treatment where its administration is contraindicated.\n",

      "\tSevere sepsis and septic shock are a primary cause of death in patients in intensive care unit (ICU). Investigations upon genetic susceptibility profile to systemic complications during severe infections are a field of increasing scientific interest. Particularly when adaptive immune system is compromised or immature, innate immunity plays a key role in the immediate defense against invasive pathogens. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a serum protein that recognizes a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms and activates complement cascade via the antibody-independent pathway. More than 30% of humans harbor mutations in MBL gene (MBL2) resulting in reduced plasmatic levels and activity. Increased risk of infection acquisition has been largely documented in MBL-deficient patients, but the real impact of this form of innate immunosuppression upon clinical outcome is not clear. In critically ill patients higher incidence and worse prognosis of severe sepsis/septic shock appear to be associated with low-producers haplotypes. However an excess of MBL activation might be also harmful due to the possibility of an unbalanced proinflammatory response and an additional host injury. Strategies of replacement therapies in critically ill patients with severe infections are under investigation but still far to be applied in clinical practice.\n",

      "\tBackground: Although allergic asthma is a complex area with many interacting factors involved, the 'hygiene hypothesis' proposes that a lack of exposure to infection during childhood may polarise the immune system towards allergen-reactive Th2-type responses in genetically susceptible individuals. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role within the innate immune system and TLR7 agonists have previously been shown to up-regulate Th1 responses and down-regulate Th2 responses to allergens in murine models of allergic or chronic asthma. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of the novel TRL7 agonist AZD8848, which has been developed as an antedrug. Methods: In this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, AZD8848 60 μg or placebo was administered intranasally once-weekly for 8 weeks in patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma (NCT00999466). Efficacy assessments were performed at 1 and 4 weeks after the last dose. The primary outcome was the late asthmatic response (LAR) fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) after allergen challenge at 1-week post-treatment. Results: AZD8848 significantly reduced average LAR fall in FEV 1 by 27% vs. placebo at 1 week after treatment (p = 0.035). This effect was sustained at 4 weeks post-treatment; however, it did not reach clinical significance. AZD8848 reduced post-allergen challenge methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) vs. placebo at 1 week post-dosing (treatment ratio: 2.20, p = 0.024), with no effect at 4 weeks. There was no significant difference between the two groups in plasma cytokine, sputum Th2 cytokine or eosinophil responses post-allergen challenge at 1 week after treatment. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. AZD8848 was generally well tolerated. Conclusions and clinical relevance: In patients with allergic asthma, TLR7 agonists could potentially reduce allergen responsiveness by stimulating Type 1 interferon responses to down-regulate the dominant Th2 responses.

      "\tPathogenesis of sepsis includes complex interaction between pathogen activities and host response, manifesting highly variable signs and symptoms, possibly delaying diagnosis and timely life-saving interventions. This study applies traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Zheng diagnosis in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock to evaluate its adaptability and use as an early predictor of sepsis mortality. Three-year prospective observational study enrolled 126 septic patients. TCM Zheng diagnosis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and blood samples for host response cytokines measurement (tumor necrosis factor-, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8, Interleukin-10, Interleukin-18) were collected within 24 hours after admission to Intensive Care Unit. Main outcome was 28-day mortality; multivariate logistic regression analysis served to determine predictive variables of the sepsis mortality. APACHE II score, frequency of Nutrient-phase heat, and Qi-Xu and Yang-Xu Zhengs were significantly higher in nonsurvivors. The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified Yang-Xu Zheng as the outcome predictor. APACHE II score and levels of five host response cytokines between patients with and without Yang-Xu Zheng revealed significant differences. Furthermore, cool extremities and weak pulse, both diagnostic signs of Yang-Xu Zheng, were also proven independent predictors of sepsis mortality. TCM diagnosis \"Yang-Xu Zheng\" may provide a new mortality predictor for septic patients.\n",

      "\tThe role of host genetic variation in pneumonia development and outcome is poorly understood. We studied common polymorphisms in the genes of proinflammatory cytokines (IL6 rs1800795, IL8 rs4073, IL1B rs16944), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL10 rs1800896, IL4 rs2243250, IL13 rs20541) and toll-like receptors (TLR2 rs5743708 and rs4696480, TLR4 rs4986791, TLR9 rs352139, rs5743836 and rs187084) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (390 cases, 203 controls) and nosocomial pneumonia (355 cases, 216 controls). Experimental data were included in a series of 11 meta-analyses and eight subset analyses related to pneumonia susceptibility and outcome. TLR2 rs5743708 minor genotype appeared to be associated with CAP/Legionnaires' disease/pneumococcal disease. In CAP patients, the IL6 rs1800795-C allele was associated with severe sepsis/septic shock/severe systemic inflammatory response, while the IL10 rs1800896-A allele protected against the development of these critical conditions. To contribute to deciphering of the above results, we performed an in silico analysis and a qualitative synthesis of literature data addressing basal and stimulated genotype-specific expression level. This data together with database information on transcription factors' affinity changes caused by SNPs in putative promoter regions, the results of linkage disequilibrium analysis along with SNPs functional annotations supported assumptions about the complexity underlying the revealed associations. Pneumonia, one of the most common infectious diseases, is associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pneumonia is classified according to the site of acquisition as community-acquired (CAP) and hospital-acquired (or nosocomial) pneumonia (HAP or NP), which includes healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). HAP tends to be a more serious problem than CAP since HAP patients have an increased risk of infection caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms, besides they are often older and burdened by comorbidities. Pneumonia is considered to be the the most prevalent cause of sepsis associated with the highest mortality rates 1 . In infection, host genetic background may be of even more importance than in cancer and cardiovascular diseases which are known to have a high hereditary component 2 . Most infectious phenotypes result from a complex interplay between multiple genetic factors related to host and pathogen genetics and a variety of non-genetic factors. Since infectious diseases are related to immune-mediated disorders, genetic susceptibility loci for immune traits can be considered as good candidates in genetic association studies of pneumonia and its complications 3 . The first line of defence of the innate immune system is represented by pattern-recognition receptors that sense bacterial, viral or fungal molecular structures and induce systemic inflammation. The most studied class of pattern-recognition receptors is that of the toll-like receptors (TLRs). Once inflammation has been launched a crosstalk between pro-and anti-inflammatory branches of the immune response should provide a balanced immune reaction crucial for a favorable resolution of infection. Genetic studies of pneumonia are not numerous while investigations assessing the role of host genetics in sepsis due to pneumonia are even more unfrequent. Furthermore, to date there are no GWAS reported for pneumonia. Meta-analyses of genetic susceptibility to pneumonia provided very limited coverage of common genetic 1 V. A.

      "\tIn an experimental rat myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury model, blood pressure and metabolic impairments related to insult severity. By contrast, cardiac contractility and cardiac output showed no significant temporal change. This study demonstrates that application of innovative design of an electrocardiogram exam accessory device can solve the main problem of system and assist to set up first ambulance prehospital telemetry electrocardiogram system in Asia and further improve ambulance prehospital electrocardiogram implantation rate in Kaohsiung city. Over the two year period, there was an increase in admissions and discharges from ICU. This was associated with an increase in the midnight bed occupancy rate from 79.5 % in 2014 to 84.3 % in 2015. However, this was linked with a 7 fold rise in readmissions within 48 hours and an associated hospital mortality rate higher than both the previous year and national average. An increasing demand for ICU services can have an adverse effect on the quality of care delivered. Further research is needed to inform clinicians and commissioners how quality can be maintained with increasing demand. Our project has demonstrated that a series of simple interventions can help to optimise mechanical ventilation and oxygen titration within critical care. There have been associated benefits in terms of safe prescribing and a reduction in our reliance on arterial blood gas analysis. This continuous quality improvement program shows that the systematic use of evidence based and PDCA-cycle driven process improvements may contribute to reduce VAP-rate. Although confounding factors were not controlled, goal oriented MMC reduced some adverse event and probably mortality rate especially with continuous monitoring and improvement. Preliminary results show differences in nurse/patient ratios and Care burdened measurement (VTS) with differences in and quality measurements in general critical care units. The ad hoc tool developed was easy to use and showed adequate psychometric properties of validity and reliability which could be improved by removing some items that showed low correlations. Resistance was associated with previous stay in wards, previous surgery and antibiotic treatment previous to surgery. The implementation of antibiotic protocols has had a positive impact as it was significantly associated with reduction on the length of ICU stay and ICU mortality, as well as consumption and costs associated with antibiotic therapy The low response rate and the potential for response bias due to the most dissatisfied relatives declining to respond limit this study. Its strengths are that it provides individualised feedback which can be used to enhance quality of care locally. Future quality improvement projects will target improving communication and include disseminating a study summary to staff members to highlight the importance of communication, more information in the waiting room on expectations in the intensive care unit and the use of family ward rounds. Better right ventricular function is a risk factor for the development of severe primary graft dysfunction. Preoperative estimation of right ventricular function could allow early identification of recipients at increased risk, who would benefit the most from careful perioperative management in order to limit pulmonary overflow. The pathophysiology of PAP is characterized by altered alveolocapillary diffusion and intrapulmonary shunt, thus significantly responsive to FiO 2 and PEEP, respectively. During monopulmonary ventilation, shunt is reduced by the lateral position, which provides a better perfusion of the ventilated lung, and the elevated hydrostatic lavage pressures, which are able to limit perfusion in the contralateral lung under WLL. were of Category C, who were admitted to ICU directly. 71.6 % (n = 58) were managed with non invasive ventilatory support only, and 14.6 % (n = 12) were intubated and mechanically ventilated. 10 out of 12 patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation belonged to Category C. 75 % (n = 9) of intubated patients had refractory hypoxemia (mean PaO2/FIO2 ratio 61.33 ± 4.05), and 6 patients required early prone ventilation. 8.5 % (n = 7) patients died and all of them were mechanically ventilated. 89 % (n = 73) were successfully discharged from the hospital. Mean ICU and hospital LOS was 3.83 ± 4.06 days and 7.53 ± 4.2 days respectively. Higher mortality rates was also seen in those patients who had more than 3 days of time lag for initiation of oseltamivir after the symptom onset (n = 5). Conclusions Influenza A H1N1 pneumonia is a significant burden during epidemics associated with a high morbidity. The mortality among severe refractory ARDS patients who were invasively ventilated is very high. The clinical profile of patients admitted to the ICU with severe/status asthmaticus is a young male, with requirements of invasive mechanical ventilation after the failure in using medical gases such as helium and noninvasive mechanical ventilation. The strategy of ventilation is protective with permissive hypercapnia. Introduction Viral influenza, especially influenza A (H1N1) pandemic influenza, is associated with a significant increase in morbidity and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions. High IAP predicts failure of SBT and need for re-intubation within 48 hours. The outcome of adult ICU patients was associated with both type and duration of life support. RRT seemed to be associated with worst outcome, potentially because kidney failure often occurs concomitantly to respiratory and circulatory failure. Physiotherapists frequently include neurological status, work of breathing, PCF, secretion load and NIF in their assessment for extubation. They predominantly use neurological status, cough strength and secretion load to inform recommendations regarding extubation. The extubation failure rate of 15 % is in keeping with current literature although the studied sample size was small. Reclassification after 24 hours using two simple cutoffs improves prognostication in mild ARDS patients. The incidence of ARDS in a developed S.E Asia country is comparable to European reported rates. The proportion of ventilated patients developing ARDS is lower than international studies published in different regions. However, management strategies varied considerably. A trend towards improved mortality with less fluid was observed but not statistically significant. Higher than expected mortality could be explained by the exclusion criteria for the FACTT population in particular chronic lung disease. Further education of junior medical and nursing staff, a daily review of fluid balance has been emphasised and re-audit in 18 months to keep awareness high were recommended. For ARDS patients, younger patients had lower mortality than older patients. For ARDS patients older than 65 years, the age did not influence the hospital mortality. Introduction ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by increased lung weight and loss of lung aeration. Recently, prone position as adjunct to lung protective ventilation demonstrated significant mortality reduction in ARDS patients [1] . Lung Ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool that could help in diagnosis and guide management at the bedside. Performance of serial CT scans, the gold standard for lung recruitment assessment, can be challenging and not feasible outside research protocols. For patients with influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia complicated respiratory failure, high incidence developed to severe ARDS but not correspond to high mortality rate. There is agreement between the fast and the slow titration Method and the PEEP titration can be performed easily in less than 7 minutes with EIT monitoring, at bedside. Greater lung strain and lung inhomogeneities increase the energy delivered to the respiratory system by the tidal volume. The presence of frailty in critically ill elderly patients increased the need for IMV. After initiation of IMV, frailty had no impact on weaning and mortality in these patients. On the other hand, as the need for IMV, comorbidities in the ICU and therefore overall mortality are found to be incresead with fraility. In this large population-based cohort study, indices of low iron status were associated with increased risk of BSI. Iron is a crucial element in our immune response and these findings suggest that alterations in this fine tuned system could influence the risk of BSI. Our study showed that increased BMI was not related to increased survival. Leptin levels were lower in patients with septic shock compared to control patients. Although leptin levels correlated with BMI, there was no difference in leptin levels between surviving and nonsurviving patients. Muscle mass and function decrease during a long ICU stay, and these changes are correlated. Use of these bedside Method to guide therapeutic management needs to be assessed. Prone position combined with post-pylorus feeding can improve the prognosis of severe ARDS cuased by pulmonary infection after renal transplantation. In critically ill patients, permissive underfeeding may be associated with lower mortality rates than standard-protocol feeding. It is evident that permissive underfeeding is a strategy that should be considered in the ICU septic patient. Employing such an approach may offer clinical benefit. This cohort of ICU patients with complex SAP showed profound muscle wasting, greatest in those with persistent severe inflammation. Identification of preventative strategies is a research priority. Based on the results of this study, different PN solutions with different lipid compositions do not seem to alter the oxidant status as evaluated by the thiol/disulphide homeostasis. Although olive oil is expected to promote PON1 activity, this could not be demonstrated in this study. Prospective, randomized, dose dependent studies may be planned for further evaluation. Nurses were accepting of this process as evidenced by the few missed tests. Tests weren't done due to confusion over tube types requiring the test, inability to aspirate fluid from the tube, and forgetting. This created an opportunity for staff education to improve our process. Our data suggest that gastric aspirate pH ≤ 5.5 alone is not a reliable marker of gastric feeding tube placement when patients receive acid inhibiting drugs. There is opportunity to develop a confirmation bundle including a description of the aspirate, recording of length of the tube at insertion, and use of acid suppressing therapy. The possibility of underfeeding is an opportunity to implement a volume based EN protocol to allow the nurse to adjust the hourly volume of EN to compensate for time EN is held. This ICU QI project implemented a best practice following a PDSA cycle. Although this was a small study, there is clearly a danger in relying on visual interpretation of colour change of CE marked pH indicator strips to confirm correct placement of naso/orogastric feeding tubes. Future/further studies intend to compare alternative Method of pH quantification, incuding electronic pH testing devices. The maximum dose of norepinephrine had an independent prognostic value in septic shock. Doses higher than 1 μg/Kg/min are associated with a clear worse prognosis, so it could be considered the limit of refractory septic shock. Resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 vs Ringer's acetate did not affect TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 plasma concentrations and changes in these cytokines were not associated with 90-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis. Consequently, our results suggest that the increased mortality seen with HES in the 6S trial was not mediated by early changes in systemic inflammation. Our study suggested that the timing of maximum BNP concentrations and the maximum daily fluid balance might parallel in septic patients. However, the peak BNP concentrations tended to follow the maximum daily fluid balance as the patients get older. Thus, BNP cannot be used to estimate the refilling phase. The main finding in this prospective randomized study was that the use of gelatin in resuscitation of patients with septic shock does not confer any advantage over saline in recruitment of sublingual microcirculation. SpvO2 showed good correlation with ScvO2 in patients with severe sepsis. Therefore, it may be a useful tool for early implication of hemodynamic optimization in patients with severe sepsis. High RDW is associated with higher mortality in sepsis patients and is higher in patients who developed respiratory failure during ICU stay. RDW showed significant correlations with shock index and lactate levels. The installation of progressive microcirculatory dysfunction has been identified as a crucial factor in the development of MODS in sepsis, which is why the identification, prevention or recovery of microcirculatory damage has been a major focus of research. In clinical practice, the sublingual region has been the site of choice for evaluation of dysfunction in sepsis, mainly for ease of access. However, there are doubts as to its validity in relation to microcirculation of other organs commonly committed in sepsis. This study aimed to compare the sublingual microcirculation with intestinal, during the initial phase of sepsis in order to assess whether the sites with the same embryological origin have similarities in microcirculatory dynamics. All peripheral indexes were influenced by the decreased blood flow, but the fCO 2 gap and the fLACT gap were altered earlier; these indexes could potentially be useful to detect tissue hypoperfusion during sepsis. During the first week of ICU admission, the excess of fluids seems to be caused by hidden fluids (maintenance and drug-related fluids). Furthermore, these appear to be related with a higher mortality, as does an insufficient resuscitation within the first 6 hours of ICU admission. Most of the ICU nursing team has an effort-reward imbalance, which is higher in nurse aides due to a lower perception of rewards. Burnout seems not to be a problem, but low degree of personal accomplishment suggests that is necessary to perform early interventions based on the recognition and opportunities for personal development, specifically on nurse aides, this interventions could help to maintain low levels of burnout and improve effort reward imbalance. The findings support the theory of ZOHAR (2000, 2003) about the safety climate that is meaningful for intensive care nurses. Which refers to a common perception among members in all aspects of the organizational environment, that dictates the behavior at work and the extent to which certain aspects are rewarded and supported in the organization. There are differences between the general intensive care and cardiac intensive care in evaluating patient safety and an atmosphere of safety, particularly in assessing and evaluating the work area corporate policy. This meta-analysis shows that continuous P cuff -control appears to reduce the incidence of VARI. However, the number of included studies is small, and there is an inherent risk of bias due to the unblinded designs. Introduction acute kidney injury (AKI) is a commom complication after heart transplantation and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The incidence of acute kidney injury in patients undergoing heart transplantation was 86 %. The mortality was higher with the presence of AKI. Understanding nursing workload and activity is complex and there are numerous tools available to measure this. Nursing Activities Score (NAS) was the most extensively examined tool, with generally reliable results focusing on the whole of the ICU nurse's workload so most suitable for evaluating overall staffing levels. The risk based model provides a means of determining nurse allocation around risk as opposed to Workload or patient dependency. However, we concluded that there is a scope to develop a new tool using the elements from the tools examined in this review which then needs to be tested in clinical practice. A 10 minute massage intervention was found to result in decreased levels of self-reported stress levels in ICU clinicians in this single center study. Exploring the impact of stress reducing interventions for ICU clinicians requires further investigation as part of an overall focus in promoting a healthy work environment in the ICU. Implementation of a programme of prehabilitation is feasible in patients undergoing major oesophagogastric surgery and was associated with improved outcomes preoperatively. These improvements were associated with a higher level of mobility at the point of critical care discharge and shorter hospital length of stay. Future appropriately powered research is needed to confirm these findings. Expert users with significant experience using the conventional pump interface demonstrated a more efficient and safer performance using the central control display. The central control display had a better overall usability than the conventional pump control interface, despite participants never having used it before. The results of this Determining renal angina score in patients admitted to the ICU might be a cornerstone for treatment and prevention of renal failure, especially in patients within the very high and high risk groups. This will allow clinicians to be very suspicious of the slightest sCr elevation (as low as 0.1 mg/dl), as it can predict the need for CRRT, and thus establish preventive maneuvers or initiate replacement therapy early. The incidence of AKI remained below the baseline from 2012. Though resolution of AKI did not occur in most. Further follow up is required by GP's to ensure further injury doesn't occur and to highlight caution. There was no evidence of AKI within the surgical discharge summary. Our recommendation is to write ICU discharge letters including such events. Although the incidence of AKI has remained lower, AKI still occurs. Identifying patients at risk for AKI during pre-op assessment is recommended. Modifiable risk factors should be optimized and high risk patients should be identified prior to cardiac surgery as recommended in the literature to reduce this complication further. New clinical criteria of sepsis have sufficient specificity and high sensitivity in patients receiving anticancer therapy. We observed a strong correlation between neuropsychological scores and morphometric changes over time suggesting (1) occurrence of tertiary lesions and (2) that lesions location influence functional outcome. These data provide further insight into early and late pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunctions after TBI. Objectives The goal of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine in the PICU settings during the prolonged infusion to assess the influence of routinely collected covariates on underlying PK parameters. CRRT for refractory metabolic acidosis in the context of cardiac instability is used in the critically ill patient as an adjunct strategy and is applied earlier than CRRT initiated for other indications. We observed that ischemic heart disease was by far the most common cause of cardiac arrest, while non-structural cardiomyopathies accounted for a very low part of diagnosis. Young patients victims of a sudden unexplained death shared similar baseline characteristics and outcome with patients with non-structural cardiomyopathies. Focusing on this subgroup of patients for further investigations and follow-up may help in managing themselves and their relatives. Note: This abstract has been previously published and is available at [1] . It is included here as a complete record of the abstracts from the conference. In refractory septic shock patients, after the SSC measures correctly applied in time, an early horizontal treatment with HFVVCHV and HFVVCVHV could improve the prognosis. Serum NGAL might reflects systemic inflammation with patient in emergency department. Inhaled xenon in combination with mild therapeutic hypothermia may protect against ischemic myocardial injury as demonstrated by significantly attenuated short-term TnT release and better left ventricular function when compared with hypothermia treatment alone. These observations suggest that inhaled xenon may provide cardioprotective effect in OHCA patients. We concluded that a more restrictive fluid resuscitation strategy might shorten the period of mechanical ventilation in major burn patients. The aggressive resuscitation fluids should be tapered down quickly after 72 hours. Results 85 patients were included. In Table 96 we described the characteristics of the study population. The beginning of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) maneuvers were immediate on ward, according to IHCA protocol. The arrival of IHCA team was less than 5 minutes in all cases. Figure 117 shows the distribution of NEWS in the IHCA analyzed. In 43.5 % of cases there are not enough information to make a NEWS. In the remaining patients it was able to perform the NEWS although we could only obtain all data in 6.5 % of patients, in the remaining 50 % of IHCA in which was calculated the NEWS some data (vital sings) was missing. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturations were the most frequent missed data. It could be probably underestimating the NEWS performed. Figure 118 shows the relationship between a greater hospital mortality and a higher NEWS. Conclusions Abnormal vital signs are common within 24 hours before IHCA events on hospital wards. A suitable recording vital signs could be useful to alert patients at risk and anticipate in the detection of IHCA. Introduction We conducted a retrospective review of all our ICU admissions post cardiac arrest to identify OOHVF survivors and compare our own care in the post TTM era with ILCOR standards of care and unit guidelines. Objectives To analyse the electronic record of all OOHVF patients admitted to our unit between October 2014 and July 2015 and identify Fig. 116 (abstract A303) . National Early Warning Score (NEWS) Use of EEG and SSEP to assist prognostication common on our unit in prolonged coma. The incidence of seizures is common in the post TTM phase. Introduction Sudden cardiac death represents a major health problem. In adults, the prevalence of out of hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) attended by the emergency medical services is 75 per 100,000. Mortality remains high, and exceeds 90 %. It is well documented that patients with a shockable rhythm have a consistently higher survival than those whose initial cardiac rhythm is non-shockable (1). Objectives The aim of this study was to look at outcome from cardiac arrests admitted to a tertiary referral service and assess whether the presentation of a shockable rhythm was associated with a better prognosis. Methods A retrospective case note review over a one year period of all patients admitted to the Golden Jubilee National hospital with an OHCA with initial rhythm being ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) were included. We looked at cause of cardiac arrest, ICU survival and dependance upon survival, age and length of stay. Results Sixty three patients were identified, and a full data set obtained for 59. Median age of admission was 59 years, with age range from 26 years to 83 years. All presenting rhythms were either VF or VT. 58 % of this cohort of patients survived post cardiac arrest. Median length of stay was 5 days (IQ range 1-14days). Of the 34patients that survived, 32 of these patients went on to live an independant life. Of the 25patients that died, all of these patients died during their admission to Intensive Care and did not die post ICU discharge. Interestingly, patients whose cause of cardiac arrest was purely arrhythmogenic all survived to hospital discharge, although these numbers are small (n = 11). Conclusions Mortality from cardiac arrest is high and places a huge burden on ICU services. The median length of stay for OHCA patients is 5 days, and with patient numbers in this study is attributable to one ICU bed per day. Their length of stay is thought to quantify the difficulties in prognostication of survival in this cohort of patients, particularly when it comes to the secondary brain injury. Introduction Quantity of blood loss during liver resection is known to be a predictor for poor clinical outcome (1). One generally used approach for minimization of blood loss is to decrease central venous pressure (CVP) (2) . The rationale for this concept is that low CVP is supposed to reduce hepatic blood congestion. Objectives In order to assess blood congestion of the liver we aimed to evaluate the influence of a positive-end-expiratory-pressure (PEEP) and positioning of the patient on CVP and venous hepatic blood flow in patients undergoing liver resection. Further, we analyzed correlation between CVP and venous hepatic blood flow parameters. , p = 0,021 respectively) whereas no significant changes of flow velocity of the portal vein occurred in any of the maneuvers. No correlations between CVP and diameters or flow velocities of the right hepatic and the portal vein were found. Conclusions Changes of central venous pressure due to changes of PEEP and positioning were not correlated with changes of venous liver blood flow. Therefore, those strategies aiming for low central venous pressure maneuvers in liver resection are not supported by these results. Introduction There are few data reporting which hemodynamic variables are associated with outcome 1 Despite the widespread of echocardiography, indices to assess the cardiac function in ICU are the same used in the cardiology ward although they have not been validated. Systolic longitudinal function (MAPSE) and total isovolumic time (t-IVT), although under recognized, are sensitive and early marker of myocardial perfusion mismatch and, the latter, of cardiac output(CO) and VO2 changes in patients with coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure1. Objectives We sought to determine the correlation between echocardiographic systo-diastolic indices, including t-IVT and MAPSE, and hemodynamic parameters and their outcome value on 30-days mortality in the cardiothoracic ICU. Methods The local ethical committee approved the study. We retrospectively analyzed data for patients (n = 131; age 59 ± 18.3; 61.3 % male) admitted to ICU requiring an echocardiography from January to August 2012. Patients were divided in 3 groups: 55 patients had severe respiratory failure; 40 patients after cardiac surgery and 36 had primary cardiocirculatory failure. In addition to demographic and hemodynamic parameters, echocardiographic indices included: MAPSE (M-mode on the four portion of the mitral annulus), ejection fraction(EF), fractional shortening(FS), E/ A, E/E', Doppler assessment ejection time (ET-aortic forward flow)& filling time(FT-mitral inflow), t-IVT (calculated as [60-(total ET + total FT)]) and SV&CO derived from aortic VTI. Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, categorical variables were compared using the Pearson χ2 test. The significance of differences in mortality between groups was assessed using the log-rank test. Results In univariate analysis a strong inverse correlation was found between t-IVT and MAPSE and SV&CO. In the univariate logistic analysis, SV&CO, MAPSE and t-IVT were all good predictors of the 30 days outcome. In the multivariate model, along with SAPS II (HR 1.07, IC 95 %1.05-1.098), t-IVT (HR 5.1, IC 95 % 2. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 8) and MAPSE (HR 0.17, IC95%0.02 -0.97)showed to be independent predictors of mortality. EF and FS do not correlate with other echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters and no relation with outcome was found. Conclusions This is the first study investigating the role of those echocardiographic indices in the ICU cohort. EF, a validated index to stratify patients according to the systolic function, failed to correlate with hemodynamic parameters and outcome. t-IVT, index of systodiastolic interaction correlating with the consequences, in term of cardiac output, of those variations, and MAPSE resulted the most sensitive parameters reflecting cardiac efficiency and outcome. Introduction To improve accessibility, central vein catheterization in upper body region classically done in trendelenburg position but it may impose potential disadvantages to respiratory system and disturb physiologic status of many other organs. Passive leg raising (PLR), a simple maneuver , widely used to improve cardiac preload and to predict patients' volume responsiveness could be an alternative. Objectives In this study, we evaluated the effect of PLR maneuver on right internal jugular vein (RIJV) diameter in intensive care unit patients under mechanical ventilation. Methods As a prospective study , twenty patients under synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) without valvular heart problem or heart failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome were studied. RIJV diameter was measured with bedside color Doppler sonography of neck , first in supine position and then for second and third measurement, after 30°PLR for 1 and 10 minutes. Measurements were at the end of inspiratory cycle with positive end expiratory pressure of 5. We chose 30°PLR to keep bedridden patients away from possible damage that may be induced with higher upward slope. Results RIJV diameter increased with 30°PLR maneuver , more prominent after 1 minute in comparison to 10 th minute time point . Mean RIJV diameter was 11.66 mm in supine, 13.37 mm (P = 0.001) and 12.95 mm (P = 0.005), 1 and 10 minutes after 30°PLR maneuver respectively . Increments in diameter were slightly lower than that associated with trendelenburg position reported in other studies . No complication was noted. Conclusions PLR maneuver can be safely considered as an alternative to trendelenberg position to increase internal jugular vein diameter in mechanically ventilated patients. Introduction Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive and radiation free bedside monitoring technology, primarily used to detect ventilation disorders. First experimental data in animals suggests that measurement of central hemodynamics within the descending aorta might become possible with EIT. 1 To achieve this goal, it is first necessary to determine within the EIT images the exact location of an individual´s aorta. Objectives The aim of this study was to improve and validate an algorithm to automatically detect the aorta by EIT using a hypertonic saline bolus. 2 Methods Ten domestic pigs were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. A bolus of hypertonic saline (10 mL, 20 %), with a higher conductivity than blood was administered into the ascending aorta while EIT data were recorded. The resulting EIT images were analyzed pixel by pixel to identify the aortic pixel (p A ), in which the bolus caused the highest transient impedance peak in time (Fig. 120) . After completion of the EIT measurements a thoracic computed tomography scan (CT) was performed for each pig. The CT-images were segmented individually for the relevant anatomical structures. EIT images were reconstructed using the GREIT model, based on the individual´s thoracic contours derived from the segmented CTimages. 3 The resulting spatial resolution of EIT images was 3 mm / pixel.\n",

      "\tBackground: Viruses are important triggers of asthma exacerbations. They are also detected outside of exacerbation. Alteration of anti-viral response in asthmatic patients has been shown although the mechanisms responsible for this defect remain unclear. The objective of this study was to compare in virus-infected and not-infected allergic asthmatic children, aged 6 to 16 years, admitted to hospital for a severe exacerbation, the innate immune response and especially the expression of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and their function. Methods: Virus identification was performed both during the exacerbation and at steady state (eight weeks later). Data assessed at both periods included clinical features, anti-viral response and inflammation (in sputum and plasma), and PRR expression/function in blood mononuclear cells. Results: Viruses were identified in 46 out of 72 children (median age 8.9 years) during exacerbation, and among them, in 17 at steady state. IFN-β, IFN-γ and IL-29 levels in sputum and plasma were similar between infected and not infected patients at both times, as well as the expression of TLR3, RIG-I and MDA5 in blood monocytes and dendritic cells. Airway inflammation in infected patients was characterized by significantly higher IL-5 concentration and eosinophil count. Compared to patients only infected at exacerbation, the re-infected children significantly exhibited lower levels of IFN-γ in plasma and sputum at exacerbation associated with modifications in PRR expression and function in blood mononuclear cells. These re-infected patients also presented an airway neutrophilic inflammation at steady state. Conclusion: Our results reports in asthmatic children that impaired anti-viral response during virus-induced exacerbation is more pronounced in a subgroup of patients prone to re-infection by virus. This subgroup is characterized by altered PRR function and a different pattern of airway inflammation. Trial registration: This multicenter prospective study was approved by the regional investigational review board (ref: 08/07).\n",

Although many respiratory illnesses are self-limiting viral infections that resolve with time and supportive care, it can be critical to identify the causative pathogen at an early stage of the disease in order to implement effective antimicrobial therapy and infection control. Over the last few years, diagnostics for respiratory infections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel assays and the availability of updated tests for newer strains of pathogens. Newer laboratory methods are rapid, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards, although the clinical utility of these assays is still under evaluation.

      "\tDEM has properties that make it invaluable in responding to a sudden infective threat, either accidental or deliberate. Its quick response, open view, certainty, and not requiring special reagents in situations out of the ordinary, show its usefulness when clear answers are needed urgently. For the diagnosis of febrile vesicular skin diseases, be they zoonotic OPV diseases or clinical emergencies in immunocompromised patients, DEM is particularly well suited as the diagnostic materials are easily accessible, without the need for taking biopsies [44] . In these situations, it is an essential component of the diagnostic service. It is also important not to forget its unique potential to defuse fraught situations by showing that worst fears have not been realized. By being able to exclude the worst possible cause at an early stage, by finding something less dire, DEM has a particular value. Moreover, in an emergency, any good EM will do, provided the experienced staff and the instrument are immediately available. DEM should be used as a front-line test in any case of suspected bioterrorism and to search for a (possibly) highly dangerous aetiological agent in severely ill and still undiagnosed patients. DEM may also be life-saving when normally less pathogenic agents are involved, as the following example shows: On a late Friday afternoon in 1978, hg was called to see a patient in the Isolation Ward at the Virchow-Klinikum (opposite the Robert Koch Institute, RKI) in Berlin. He found a febrile unconscious middle-aged male patient with a vesicular rash and signs of raised intracranial pressure (Figure ??) , and collected vesicle fluid at the bed-side directly onto microscope grids. Fifteen minutes later, NS-DEM at the RKI revealed numerous virus particles typical of the Herpesvirales order (Figure ??) , showing that this was a case of adult chickenpox with an encephalitis-a severe primary VZV infection in an adult may be severe enough to resemble smallpox. In this life-threatening situation, DEM had excluded a poxvirus infection, however unlikely it may have been, as well as the allergic shock, which had been the clinicians' provisional diagnosis. DEM had rapidly identified the true cause; the patient was treated with high-dose acyclovir and recovered completely. The speed, open view, certainty and the lack of a need for specific reagents for DEM had produced a result quickly enough to save a life, while at the same time excluding other, even worse, causes. Last, but not least, without a proper hint of where to go with the diagnostics, clinical or environmental samples may turn out difficult to diagnose by NAT, especially when inhibitory substances are present [114] . Moreover, seeing the culprit provides a strong memory hook because virus morphology is easily remembered together with other pieces of structure-function information.\n",

      "\tThere is a pressing need for research targeting persistent digestive disorders as a coherent clinical problem rather than as a disconnected collection of pathologies. This would allow the elaboration of evidence-based diagnosistreatment algorithms centred on patients in resourceconstrained settings, where data availability is scarce and patient management often driven by experience and local beliefs. This is the overarching goal of the NIDIAG consortium, focusing on digestive disorders as discussed here, as well as on neurological disorders [23] and persistent fever [24] . Additionally, such investigations will optimise the use of existing diagnostic tests and advance the development of new methods, which are ideally able to concurrently detect a broad spectrum of intestinal pathogens with a high sensitivity and specificity, and which are simple and affordable enough to be performed in lowincome countries where prevalences of persistent digestive disorders are generally high. Moreover, the thorough evaluation of reference tests for intestinal pathogens can serve as diagnostic 'gold' standard in the standardisation and validation of easily applicable RDTs, which are highly needed tools in resource-constrained field settings. Finally, such in-depth investigations are not only important for individual patient management, but also for public health policy making (e.g. to assess the efficacy and costeffectiveness of ongoing preventive chemotherapy control programmes targeting helminthiases). There is a need for improved diagnostics for persistent digestive disorders in the tropics. It is desirable to conduct a multicentric study to investigate the clinical presentations and respective identified pathogens of large patient cohorts presenting with non-acute gastrointestinal diseases as a first step towards more reliable and evidence-based clinical case management in the tropics.\n",

      "\tBackground: Many systems for routine public health surveillance rely on centralized collection of potentially identifiable, individual, identifiable personal health information (PHI) records. Although individual, identifiable patient records are essential for conditions for which there is mandated reporting, such as tuberculosis or sexually transmitted diseases, they are not routinely required for effective syndromic surveillance. Public concern about the routine collection of large quantities of PHI to support non-traditional public health functions may make alternative surveillance methods that do not rely on centralized identifiable PHI databases increasingly desirable. The National Bioterrorism Syndromic Surveillance Demonstration Program (NDP) is an example of one alternative model. All PHI in this system is initially processed within the secured infrastructure of the health care provider that collects and holds the data, using uniform software distributed and supported by the NDP. Only highly aggregated count data is transferred to the datacenter for statistical processing and display. : Detailed, patient level information is readily available to the health care provider to elucidate signals observed in the aggregated data, or for ad hoc queries. We briefly describe the benefits and disadvantages associated with this distributed processing model for routine automated syndromic surveillance. For well-defined surveillance requirements, the model can be successfully deployed with very low risk of inadvertent disclosure of PHI -a feature that may make participation in surveillance systems more feasible for organizations and more appealing to the individuals whose PHI they hold. It is possible to design and implement distributed systems to support non-routine public health needs if required.\n",

      "\tThe ecological success of social insects is based on division of labour, not only between queens 20 and workers, but also among workers. Whether a worker tends the brood or forages is strongly 21 influenced by age, fertility and nutritional status, with brood carers being younger, more fecund 22 and corpulent. Here, we experimentally disentangle behaviour from age and fertility 23 in Temnothorax longispinosus ant workers and analyse how these parameters are linked to 24 whole-body gene expression. Our transcriptome analysis reveals four times more genes 25 associated with behaviour than with age and only few fertility-associated genes. Brood carers 26 exhibited an upregulation of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, whereas foragers invested in 27 metabolism. Additional simulations revealed that the experimental disassociation of co-varying 28 factors reduces transcriptomic noise, potentially explaining discrepancies between 29 transcriptomic studies on worker behaviour in other social insects.

To understand the structural connectivity of cortical and subcortical circuits in the healthy human brain could thus be of pivotal importance for detecting changes in this circuitry and to start early intervention, to assess the progress of movement rehabilitation, or the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches in neuropsychiatry. While conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography, or magnetoencephalography are able to provide detailed information about connectivity at the macro level, the sensitivity and specificity these imaging techniques put limits on the amount of detail one can obtain when measuring in vivo connectivity of human basal ganglia and thalamus. In contrast, the multiband diffusion echo planar imaging MRI sequence, which acquires multiple slices of the brain simultaneously, enables high resolution imaging of these brain structures with only short acquisition times at 3-Tesla field strength. Here, we introduce a novel protocol that allows us to generate comprehensive in vivo participant-specific probabilistic patterns and visualizations of the structural connections that exist within basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei. Moreover, we are able to map specific parcellations of these nuclei into sub-territories based on their connectivity with primary motor-, and somatosensory cortex. The detailed subcortical structural connectivity mapping introduced in this work could benefit early intervention and therapy methods for human movement rehabilitation and for treating neuropsychiatric disorders. author/funder.

We investigated a likely scenario of COVID-19 spreading in Brazil through the complex airport network of the country, for the 90 days after the first national occurrence of the disease. After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad. Methodology. We developed a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region. Results. The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all cities. The more an airport showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. We discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria. Finally, we proposed measures for containing virus spreading taking into consideration the scenario of high poverty. All rights reserved.

      "\tWe present a Cybernetics-based Dynamic Infection Model to simulate the epidemiologic characteristics of SARS-COV-2. Two polymorphic models for different city types are derived with considerations on their medical, immigration/emigration population and administrative conditions. Shanghai, Beijing, Wenzhou and Wuhan were studied to validate the infection models. More simulated results based on the successive data from 37 cities in China are listed in the appendix. Results demonstrate that the model can successfully simulate the dynamic infecting process of COVID-19, and uncontrollable risks in a city can be predicted before they come true. Additionally, administrative management can be verified by the model so that decisions can be made in time with more confidence according to the forecasts and warnings. Combined with big data of the intercity traffics, the research work is even more help-ful to future epidemic predictions. Uncontrollable risks in multiple cities could be monitored in parallel, emergency responses could be activated faster, and medical supplies would be produced precisely and transported to the right place at the right time. Currently, the outbreak in China is almost brought under control, while the international spread is developing rapidly. The global transmission is just like the situation in China one month ago. In view of this, many parameters could be reused to forecast the spread in foreign countries (South Korea, Italy, Iran, etc.), experiences should be learned from China to prevent more cities from instability. From the proposed model, we could infer the following conclusions: (1) Medical responsibility: Medical supplies should be prepared abundantly to admit all the patient with symptom onset; (2) Social responsibility: People should reduce contacts as much as possible, so that the factor C 0 can be decreased; (3) Administrative responsibility: The contact tracing rate C 1 plays a vitally significant role in stabilizing the spread. All the above mentioned responsibilities should be emphasized, so that the current situation could be stabilized before the end of May. In order to validate the CDIM model, 37 cities were simulated on Feb 9, 2020, and more data (yellow points) were used to verify the precision of estimation. Most of cities fit well with the estimation, though some cities have some deviations. This is mainly caused by the dynamic quarantining level that changes R 0 .

Proteins linked to inflammatory response, but also proteins related to chromosome segregation during mitosis, were found to be regulated. The up-regulation of the inflammatory-related proteins observed could be linked to the propagation of inflammatory reaction and lung injury that is observed in advanced stages of COVID-19 patients.\n",

      "\tPlasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)-mediated protection against cytopathic virus infection involves various molecular, cellular, tissue-scale, and organism-scale events. In order to better understand such multiscale interactions, we have implemented a systems immunology approach focusing on the analysis of the structure, dynamics and operating principles of virus-host interactions which constrain the initial spread of the pathogen. Using high-resolution experimental data sets coming from the well-described mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) model, we first calibrated basic modules including MHV infection of its primary target cells, i.e. pDCs and macrophages (Mws). These basic building blocks were used to generate and validate an integrative mathematical model for in vivo infection dynamics. Parameter estimation for the system indicated that on a per capita basis, one infected pDC secretes sufficient type I IFN to protect 10 3 to 10 4 Mws from cytopathic viral infection. This extremely high protective capacity of pDCs secures the spleen's capability to function as a 'sink' for the virus produced in peripheral organs such as the liver. Furthermore, our results suggest that the pDC population in spleen ensures a robust protection against virus variants which substantially down-modulate IFN secretion. However, the ability of pDCs to protect against severe disease caused by virus variants exhibiting an enhanced liver tropism and higher replication rates appears to be rather limited. Taken together, this systems immunology analysis suggests that antiviral therapy against cytopathic viruses should primarily limit viral replication within peripheral target organs.\n",

Also, infection was associated with a mixed Th1/Th2 response, although a Th1 profile seemed to be associated with better parasite control. This model will be very useful to further clarify the role of dogs as reservoirs and in L. (L.) mexicana transmission cycles.

If not properly accounted for, recombination can compromise many evolutionary analyses. In addition, when dealing with organisms that are not obligately sexually reproducing, recombination gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineages come into contact. Since June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 1106 laboratory-confirmed infections, with 421 MERS-CoV associated deaths as of April 16, 2015. Although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, dromedary camels have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the Middle East. In this paper we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that MERS-CoV genome has likely undergone numerous recombinations recently.

We examined the 'metavirome' of four populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes collected in 2016-2017 from Manatee County, Florida. Unexpectedly, we discovered that dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV4) was circulating in these mosquito populations, representing the first documented case of such a phenomenon in the absence of a local DENV4 human case in this county over a two-year period. We confirmed that all of the mosquito populations carried the same DENV4 strain, assembled its full genome, validated infection orthogonally by reverse transcriptase PCR, traced the virus origin, estimated the time period of its introduction to the Caribbean region, as well as explored the viral genetic signatures and mosquito-specific virome associations that potentially mediated DENV4 persistence in mosquitoes. We discuss the significance of prolonged maintenance of these DENV4 infections in Ae. aegypti that occurred in the absence of a DENV4 human index case in Manatee County with respect to the inability of current surveillance paradigms to detect mosquito vector infections prior to a potential local outbreak. Since 1999, dengue outbreaks in the continental United States (U.S.) involving local transmission have occurred episodically and only in Florida and Texas.

Intranasal exposure of mice to AlsPV resulted in no clinical signs of disease, although viral RNA was detected in the olfactory bulbs of two mice at 21 days post exposure. Oronasal challenge of ferrets resulted in subclinical upper respiratory tract infection, viral shedding in respiratory secretions, and detection of viral antigen in the olfactory bulb of the brain. These results imply that AlsPV may be similar to PIV5 in its ability to infect multiple mammalian host species.

To assign the genotypes uploaded by the user, the tool analyses the sequences one by one, genotypes through identification, alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction. This computational method allows the high-throughput classification of these virus species and genotypes in seconds. As shown experimentally, genotypes are classified most confidently using the envelope gene or complete genome sequences.

      "\tThe overall picture that emerges is that mallard ducks are very permissive to LPAI replication in their intestines without cost to fitness, and have robust immune responses that give ducks some ability to cope with the spontaneous tendency of LPAI viruses to periodically acquire high pathogenicity and broad tissue tropism. Mallard ducks are not universally resistant to disease caused by all strains of HPAIV, but are much more resistant than chickens, which lack the RIG-I receptor, and relatively more resistant than other bird species. Tight control of pro-inflammatory signaling contributes to the survival of mallards, and may be helped by a lack of viral endothelial tissue tropism and the ducks' ability to tolerate some extent of central nervous system infection. RIG-I receptor-mediated IFN-β signaling in infected cells and the rapid induction of ISGs is critical to limiting HPAI virus spread and viremia early, and to limiting inflammation. The potential strain-dependent role of viral NS1 in blocking duck RIG-I signaling is an intriguing open question. The duck ISGs IFITM3 and IFIT5 demonstrably function to restrict influenza virus and it will be interesting to see more information emerge about the rest of the duck ISG repertoire, particularly the diverse haplotypes of Mx1. The host-pathogen interactions of mallard ducks and influenza viruses are multifactorial and complex, and the relative resistance to highly-pathogenic strains likely results from a long history of host adaptation through evolutionary fine-tuning.\n",

      "\tIt has been nearly a century since the early description of microglia by Rio-Hortega; since then many more biological and pathological features of microglia have been recognized. Today, microglia are generally considered to be beneficial to homeostasis at the resting state through their abilities to survey the environment and phagocytose debris. However, when activated microglia assume diverse phenotypes ranging from fully inflamed, which involves the release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, to alternatively activated, releasing antiinflammatory cytokines or neurotrophins, the consequences to neurons can range from detrimental to supportive. Due to the different experimental sets and conditions, contradictory results have been obtained regarding the controversial question of whether microglia are \"good\" or \"bad.\" While it is well understood that the dual roles of activated microglia depend on specific situations, the underlying mechanisms have remained largely unclear, and the interpretation of certain findings related to diverse microglial phenotypes continues to be problematic. In this review we discuss the functions of microglia in neuronal survival and neurogenesis, the crosstalk between microglia and surrounding cells, and the potential factors that could influence the eventual manifestation of microglia.\n",

Whether microglia are committed to one function from the very beginning or if there is any conversion between different phenotypes remains elusive and the factors that initiate this commitment or promote its conversion are far from being clarified. Due to the invariant critical participation of microglia in most diseases, ongoing research to uncover these questions is warranted; before we are sure about the answer, any potential strategies targeting microglia to manipulate inflammation and modify a disease course are unrealistic.\n",

      "\tThe relationship between a virus and its host is a complicated affair: a myriad of factors from the virus and the host are involved in viral infection and consequential pathogenesis. During viral infections, the host must respond to the virus by putting multiple lines of defence mechanisms in place. As intracellular obligate parasites, viruses have also evolved various strategies to hijack the host machineries. In this review, we first showed how viral factors could manipulate the host cell to expedite its own replication cycle and pathogenesis. We also highlighted how multiple cellular and viral factors come into play in their long-standing battle against one another. For years, HCoVs have been identified as mild respiratory pathogens that affect the human population. However, it was the emergence of SARS-CoV that thrust these human viruses into the spotlight of the research field. Therefore, most of the HCoV research today is pertained towards SARS-CoV. While the recent MERS-CoV outbreak has been mostly limited to the Middle East region, it is likely that more emerging or re-emerging HCoVs might surface to threaten the global public health, as seen from the high mortality rates in the past two outbreaks: SARS-CoV (10%) and MERS-CoV (35%). Therefore, study of the pathogenesis of all HCoVs would gain more insights for the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.\n",

Full understanding of these changes will likely be critical to understand, and, perhaps, correct age-related disorganization of T cell homeostasis and immune function. LN stroma is critical for naïve T cell homeostasis, providing both chemokine gradients for effective trafficking into the LN, and survival signals to the naïve T cell upon arrival (7, 13) . Further, stromal cells control influx of antigen, and there is initial evidence that this process may be adversely affected by aging LN (15, 16) . Within the LN, FRCs (13) and FDCs (14) , both decline numerically and exhibit disorganized network formation, with a potential to impair interactions with T and B cells. A key challenge in front of us is to (1) understand how aging alters the structure and function of each of the stromal cellular components and their interaction and (2) dissect the functional consequences of such changes for protective immunity. The ultimate goal should be to manipulate and restore stromal cell function in response to vaccination or infection and thus provide new targets to improve immunity in the elderly.\n",

Several studies have indicated that bats have unique defense mechanisms that allow them to be persistently or latently infected with viruses.

In 2013, Zika virus spread to the immunologically naïve population in the Americas and was found to cause severe neurological symptoms. In RNA virus infections, TLR and RLR signaling pathways are activated leading to the production of IFNs and activation of antiviral responses. Most pathogenic viruses, including the Zika virus, encode proteins that interfere with innate immune responses. Zika virus infects through epithelial barriers where IFN-λ1 is an important component of the host cell defense. Here, we show that the Zika virus NS5 protein is able to interfere with the activation of IFN-λ1 promoter, by targeting the IKKε kinase of the RIG-I pathway. A more detailed understanding of the functions of ZIKV proteins on host cells will likely enable us to design new antiviral substances against this newly emerged virus infection.\n",

      "\tFrom modest beginnings as a possibly minor modification system, sumoylation has emerged as a major regulatory network that involves hundreds to thousands of proteins through direct SUMO conjugation and SIM motif-mediated interactions with sumoylated proteins. Sumoylation is now known to be involved in major cellular events including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, DNA repair, RNA processing, chromatin remodeling, and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Viruses and certain bacterial pathogens must utilize many of these cellular processes to facilitate their own gene expression and genome replication. Consequently, it is not surprising that many pathogens have evolved proteins that are regulated by sumoylation or can usurp certain aspects of the host sumoylation system to reprogram the cellular environment to be more permissive for pathogen persistence or reproduction. The recent finding that sumoylation is involved in regulating aspects of intrinsic and innate immunity, provides another rationale for why pathogens, particularly viruses, target the sumoylation system. The ability to avoid or reduce initial host defenses is obviously critical to establishing a productive infection, and dysregulating sumoylation generally or for specific targets appears to be a common mechanism for pathogens to thwart these defenses. As presented in this review, there are now a multitude of examples of how pathogens impact the sumoylation system. These range from increasing or decreasing sumoylation of single proteins, usually via direct binding of a pathogen protein, to global increases or decreases in sumoylation. Single protein targets typically are key cellular growth regulatory factors or are critical for host immune response. Global changes in sumoylation induced by pathogens are more dramatic, but also more difficult to understand functionally as identifying the critical targets versus irrelevant proteins is challenging. Mechanistically, some pathogen proteins act by mimicking sumoylation enzymes whereas others function by binding to and altering the activity of the endogenous host sumoylation enzymes. An emerging theme is that many of these interactions are mediated or enhanced through SIM-SUMO binding, and in some cases each binding partner has one or more SIM motifs and can also be sumoylated. This raises the possibility of combinatorial interactions that may subtly influence complex affinity, stability, or composition and thus have functional consequences. The next few years are likely to reveal additional important nuances about how pathogens utilize sumoylation to their own benefit as well as identifying many exciting new targets.\n",

      "\tWe affirm that the concept of global justice for all persons needs to be applied to the shortage of pediatric and adult critical care services across the globe. At the core, there is a need to remediate inequalities of access to healthcare as a fundamental human right (133) . The injustice of the disparity in healthcare requires tireless patient advocacy for equity of care and increased resources (73) . We no longer live in silos; instead, we live in an interconnected world where communications, collaboration, trade, finance, and pollution are all shared (84) . The recent Ebola epidemic served as a harsh reminder that in order to value all human life equally, there is an urgent need to bridge resource-rich and resourcelimited worlds and build effective, long-lasting partnerships across borders (83) . Critical care has often been deemed inappropriate and of lower priority than primary care efforts and, thus, has additional challenges to overcome in resource-limited settings. However, the lack of prioritization is not justified as discussed above (73) . Critics indict clinical technologies and label them as failed strategies, likely due to lack of research in the field, which devalues clinical intervention and diverts the attention from the value of critical care medicine to the overall health of the population (134) . There is no doubt that critical care and public health overlap. An Ebola virus outbreak among a mobile population who carries it to densely populated areas without adequate critical care resources and systems to contain further spread is a huge public health issue (135) . The lack of critical care resources in the center of the epidemic and the inability to increase available resources acutely has contributed to the amplification of disease burden, increasing stress on an already deficient public health system. We argue for a focus on basic pediatric critical care principals with locally appropriate adaptations in collaboration with ministries of health and community members. A concentration on international partnerships, educational initiatives, and research strategies will only help to enhance the specialty of pediatric critical care. Building capacity and evaluating efficacy of critical care interventions in resource-limited settings has the potential to greatly improve the overall outcome of critically ill children by supporting interventions at every level of patient care. The strategies outlined move us toward delivery of an adequate standard of critical care for all children globally and provide an opportunity to dramatically decrease the mortality of children in resourcelimited settings.\n",

These two outbreaks were judged to be declared as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) during 2014. This is the first time ever to have such circumstance of two PHEICs at the same time. Discussion: PHEIC, which has to be declared by WHO Director General after a recommendation of IHR Emergency Committee; is observed to start in countries with fragile health system and conflict areas. Then it rapidly spread to threaten the global public health. The year 2014 has uniquely witnessed declaration of two events as PHEIC according to IHR (2005); Polio and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Both outbreaks are caused by viruses such as H1N1 which was previously declared as PHEIC in 2009. Summary: Public Health Emergencies of International Concern in 2014 occurred in countries with weak health systems and conflicts and threatening the whole globe. International collaborative work is required to contain the event and to mobilize resources/capacities between countries. Moreover, public health surveillance systems as core capacity for IHR (2005) should be strengthened in all countries with focus on those with limited capacity and ongoing conflicts. The ultimate aim is timely detection of potential PHEIC events in the future along with early preparedness and response plans.\n",

For Arctic inhabitants, with deep cultural connection to the environment, the associated health risks to humans, animals and the environment are increasingly apparent in everyday life. Currently, we lack a full understanding of these risks to humans, animals and the Arctic environment. Now it is the time for a new comprehensive perspective of climate change impacts on Arctic health. One Health is a transdisciplinary approach ideally suited for addressing health issues in complex systems such as the Arctic. The One Health approach promotes collaborative approaches to the collection, analysis and interpretation of a wide range of data to anticipate and respond to the rapidly changing environment and its health impacts on human and animal communities. A One Health approach can provide critical lead time and early warning of impending dangers while stimulating more innovative collaborative intervention options for prevention and response. An integrated One Health approach addressing the potential health effects at the humanÁanimalÁenvironment interface will enhance the resilience of Arctic communities and the environment in the circumpolar region. Greater scientific understanding of the threats can contribute new tools for effective policy to reduce the burden of health risks and support capacity-building and preparedness. These tools include methods for assessing vulnerability, health and disease screening strategies and programmes for characterizing climate risks, identifying adaptation options, and weighing the costs and benefits of different policies. Consideration should be given to regional One Health approach in the Arctic.

Along those lines, establishing models of team-based training and diversifying health care curricula and CME/CPD programs are vital for capacity building endeavors. These steps will decrease the reliance on an expatriate health care workforce and improve the quality of health care in the region. Similarly, building capacity at undergraduate and postgraduate training levels are also steps in the right direction. CME/CPD programs are a vital component for capacity building in health care professions as they transform the existing health care systems by training the workforce to address identified population health needs. To increase the professional competence (skills and knowledge), culturally-sensitive capacity building efforts should be based on country-specific needs assessments that include an educational approach focused on problem-based and competence-based learning. Capacity building can play a vital role in addressing the major health challenges of this region, which include: an aging population, the increase of chronic non-communicable diseases, the continuing threat of infectious disease, the rising concern of mental health issues, and inequity in women's health. Capacity-building efforts within and outside of academic institutions can play a significant role in addressing gaps in the education of health professionals and strengthening of health care systems in the GCC countries.

      "\tThe study in late 2008 prior to the H1N1/2009 epidemic shows that the health system context influences how the six countries have been preparing themselves for a pandemic. The level and form of pandemic preparedness depend on existing health systems arrangements particularly its governance, resource, and existing service provision patterns. The political and historical context of previous epidemics shaped the priority given to pandemic preparation in a country. Countries with limited domestic resources rely heavily on external funding for pandemic preparation activities. The fragmentation of health information and referral systems in some countries particularly in relation to linkage with private sector providers constitutes a challenge in synergistic pandemic response. Pandemic preparation in the six Asian countries has contributed to improvement in health system surveillance, laboratory capacity, monitoring and evaluation and public communications. However, preparation for pandemic mitigation in countries with low health system resources is still rather limited. With the emergence of H1N1/2009, the previous preparation in the five developing countries based on the AHI model of poultry to human transmission became less relevant. If a pandemic is to expand beyond the early containment phase it will be a big challenge for these countries whether their health system will have enough capacity to effectively respond. A number of suggestions for improvement were presented to strengthen the pandemic preparation and mitigation as well as to overcome three areas of the underlying health system constraints -governance and stewardships, resources, and service provision. The heightened public interest and awareness on the ongoing pandemic could be mobilized towards more investment in health systems.\n",

The contract service aimed to convert village doctors, who had privately practiced for decades, into general practitioners under the government management, and better control the rampant chronic diseases. This study made a rare attempt to assess the effectiveness of public health services delivered under the contract service policy, explore the influencing mechanism and draw the implications for the policy extension in the future. Methods: Three pilot counties and a non-pilot one with heterogeneity in economic and health development from east to west of China were selected by a purposive sampling method. The case study methods by document collection, non-participant observation and interviews (including key informant interview and focus group interview) with 84 health providers and 20 demanders in multiple level were applied in this study. A thematic approach was used to compare diverse outcomes and analyze mechanism in the complex adaptive systems framework. Results: Without sufficient incentives, the public health services were not conducted effectively, regardless of the implementation of the contract policy. To appropriately increase the funding for public health by local finance and properly allocate subsidy to village doctors was one of the most effective approaches to stimulate health providers and demanders' positivity and promote the policy implementation. County health bureaus acted as the most crucial agents among the complex public health systems. Their mental models influenced by the compound and various environments around them led to the diverse outcomes. If they could provide extra incentives and make the contexts of the systems ripe enough for change, the health providers and demanders would be receptive to the transition of the policy.

Data were analysed using SPSS version 23. Results: The response rate was 67.6 % (622/920). The main age category of responders was the 20 to 30 year age category (40.5%); responders were mostly female (58.0 %). Regarding knowledge, there were significant differences among occupational categories (F = 2.811, df1 = 6, df2 = 571, p-value = 0.011). Tukey's HSD post hoc test revealed that the mean knowledge scores for professional and sales occupations differed significantly (p-value = 0.003). There was a significant association between being afraid to go for treatment and age (p-value = 0.001). Significant associations were also found between occupational grouping and education attainment with opinion about the preparedness of private medical facilities, likelihood to shun family members with Ebola, being afraid to go for treatment and preference for traditional medicine (p-value <0.05).

In Japan, primary care is the frontline against emerging infectious diseases in communities. Although the importance of pandemic preparedness in primary care has been highlighted previously, few studies have thus far investigated the preparedness among primary care practices (PCPs) or differences in the preparedness of different institutional settings. We examined PCP preparedness and response to the 2009 influenza pandemic in Japan, and explored the role of a pandemic preparedness plan during the pandemic. Methods: We used a survey questionnaire to assess how well individual PCPs in Okinawa, Japan, were prepared for the 2009 influenza pandemic. The questionnaire was mailed to all eligible PCPs (N = 465) in Okinawa, regardless of their institutional setting. In addition, we assessed the differences in the preparedness of clinics and hospitals and determined whether the national preparedness plan affected individual preparedness and response. Data were analyzed using descriptive and logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 174 (37.4%) PCPs responded to our survey. In general, high-level personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 masks (45.4%), gowns (30.5%), and eye protection (21.3%) was stocked at a low rate. Clinic-based PCPs were significantly less prepared than hospital-based PCPs to provide N95 masks (OR 0.34), gowns (OR 0.15), and eye protection (OR 0.18). In addition, only 32.8% of PCPs adopted an adequate business continuity plan (BCP). After controlling for institutional setting, reading the national preparedness plan was significantly associated with establishment of a BCP (OR 5.86), and with knowledge of how to transfer a swab specimen to a local medical laboratory (OR 5.60). Conclusions: With regard to PPE availability, PCPs (especially clinic-based PCPs) were not adequately prepared for the influenza pandemic. Awareness of the national pandemic preparedness plan is likely to promote prefecture-wide implementation of BCPs and surveillance activity.\n",

Adults and students washed their hands with soap/sanitizer an average of 6.6 and 5.2 times daily, respectively, in 2014, an increase and decrease compared to 2006 (4.8) and 2013 (6.8). Their average daily handwashing frequency in 2014, 9.8 and 8.3, was higher than in 2006 (7.6), but lower than in 2013 (10.3).The percentage of participants handwashing with soap after using the restroom (29.5%) has been increasing since 2009, but remain slower than in other countries (42% to 49%). The percentages of participants handwashing with water in 2014, 2013, and 2011 were 57.5%, 72.6%, and 71.4%, respectively. Handwashing with soap is an important national public health issue, and national projects promoting it should be given high priority. Research support is necessary to provide scientific evidence of the importance of handwashing with soap and to develop and implement evidence-based policies.\n",

      "\tLeptospirosis has been reported as an endemic in most tropical countries. Among high risk occupations, leptospirosis includes workers in agriculture and domestic animal industries. Environmental hygiene in the wet market has established a link between the presence of rodents with probability of leptospirosis infection. This study was aimed to compare the level of knowledge, attitude and preventive practice against leptospirosis between healthy Malaysian and non-Malaysian wet market workers in selected wet markets in urban areas of Selangor. A cross-sectional study in the determined area was conducted with the participation of 147 respondents. The respondents were randomly chosen from the list provided by the state agency that regulates these markets. A self-administered bilingual validated questionnaire (English and Bahasa Melayu) was distributed to the selected respondents. There were 68 (48.3%) Malaysian respondents and 79 (53.7%) non-Malaysian respondents. The majority of them were males, who attained formal education and were less than 40 years old. Meanwhile, the respondents earned less than RM3000. Among the Malaysian respondents, 80.9% were aware of leptospirosis as compared to 17.7% of the non-Malaysian colleagues (p < 0.05). All items of knowledge showed that the Malaysian respondents scored higher as compared to non-Malaysian respondents. On attitude towards infection prevention, most Malaysian respondents had a positive attitude, while most non-Malaysian respondents had undecided perception on the majority of crucial attitude items. In practicing preventive measures, there was a marked significant difference in proportion between Malaysian and non-Malaysian respondents for items on \"Specific Protection and Isolation at Source.\" There was a significant gap on knowledge, attitude and preventive practice among Malaysian workers as compared to non-Malaysian workers. Therefore, it was highly recommended the health promotion implementation should also provide specific focus on non-Malaysian workers.\n",

      "\tBackground: Food-borne Salmonella infections are a worldwide concern. During a large-scale outbreak, it is important that the public follows preventive advice. To increase compliance, insight in how the public gathers its knowledge and which factors determine whether or not an individual complies with preventive advice is crucial. Methods: In 2012, contaminated salmon caused a large Salmonella Thompson outbreak in the Netherlands. During the outbreak, we conducted an online survey (n = 1,057) to assess the general public's perceptions, knowledge, preventive behavior and sources of information. Results: Respondents perceived Salmonella infections and the 2012 outbreak as severe (m = 4.21; five-point scale with 5 as severe). Their knowledge regarding common food sources, the incubation period and regular treatment of Salmonella (gastro-enteritis) was relatively low (e.g., only 28.7% knew that Salmonella is not normally treated with antibiotics). Preventive behavior differed widely, and the majority (64.7%) did not check for contaminated salmon at home. Most information about the outbreak was gathered through traditional media and news and newspaper websites. This was mostly determined by time spent on the medium. Social media played a marginal role. Wikipedia seemed a potentially important source of information. Conclusions: To persuade the public to take preventive actions, public health organizations should deliver their message primarily through mass media. Wikipedia seems a promising instrument for educating the public about food-borne Salmonella.\n",

This situation led to delayed reactions, serious cross contamination, increased the mortality, and financial loss during the outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, and MERS. Technology shortfalls primarily included poor infrastructure and inadequate facility ventilation, which failed to support isolation and other efforts for HAIs prevention. Human factors were also responsible for the HAIs of SARS, Ebola, and MERS. Lack of knowledge can lead to the failure of identifying suspected cases and induce a lax attitude toward infection control methods, such as hand washing and the proper use of PPE. Lack of knowledge is also related to poor triaging in outpatient departments and emergency treatment areas. Governments, CDCs, and hospitals are recommended to create strategies for emergency responses to infectious outbreaks. Additionally, this strategy should be updated frequently. It is important to ensure that all HCWs understand the policies and standard operating procedures for Fig. 1 Percent of studies that report the shortfalls which impact HAI prevention and control. a Strategy shortfalls; b Technology shortfalls; c Human factors preventing HAIs. Quarantine and ventilation function should be taken into consideration in the architectural design of hospitals and healthcare facilities.

      "\tBackground: Currently there is an ongoing debate and limited evidence on the use of masks and respirators for the prevention of respiratory infections in health care workers (HCWs). This study aimed to examine available policies and guidelines around the use of masks and respirators in HCWs and to describe areas of consistency between guidelines, as well as gaps in the recommendations, with reference to the WHO and the CDC guidelines. Methods: Policies and guidelines related to mask and respirator use for the prevention of influenza, SARS and TB were examined. Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), three high-income countries and six low/middle-income countries were selected. Results: Uniform recommendations are made by the WHO and the CDC in regards to protecting HCWs against seasonal influenza (a mask for low risk situations and a respirator for high risk situations) and TB (use of a respirator). However, for pandemic influenza and SARS, the WHO recommends mask use in low risk and respirators in high risk situations, whereas, the CDC recommends respirators in both low and high risk situations. Amongst the nine countries reviewed, there are variations in the recommendations for all three diseases. While, some countries align with the WHO recommendations, others align with those made by the CDC. The choice of respirator and the level of filtering ability vary amongst the guidelines and the different diseases. Lastly, none of the policies discuss reuse, extended use or the use of cloth masks. Conclusion: Currently, there are significant variations in the policies and recommendations around mask and respirator use for protection against influenza, SARS and TB. These differences may reflect the scarcity of level-one evidence available to inform policy development. The lack of any guidelines on the use of cloth masks, despite widespread use in many low and middle-income countries, remains a policy gap. Health organizations and countries should jointly evaluate the available evidence, prioritize research to inform evidence gaps, and develop consistent policy on masks and respirator use in the health care setting.\n",

Self-stigma is prevalent among people living with HIV (PLHIV) and a major obstacle to HIV prevention and care. Objective: This study aimed to describe the experiences of stigmatization and explore the possible factors that might be associated with stigmatization among PLHIV in Hong Kong. Design: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted. Setting and participants: 15 PLHIV were recruited from two local non-governmental organizations on HIV prevention. Participants were interviewed about their views and feelings towards oneself as a PLHIV and contributing factors, experiences of discriminations, stigmatizing behaviours, issues about disclosure, social relationships and potential impact of HIV. Thematic analyses revealed three levels of factors which might be associated with stigmatization: (i) intrapersonal level (misconceptions about HIV, attribution of self-responsibility, severe state of illness, side-effects of medication), (ii) interpersonal level (discrimination, social rejection) and (iii) social level (mass media, public stereotypes). Findings provide important insights into which interventions to reduce stigmatization of PLHIV could be designed. Hong Kong, people living with HIV, qualitative, stigma\n",

We built homology models based on SARS M pro structures, and docked 1903 small molecule drugs to the models. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of the binding mode to the known M pro ligands, 4 drugs were selected for binding free energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for nelfinavir, with the binding free energy of -24.69±0.52 kcal/mol and -9.42±0.04 kcal/mol, respectively.

However, genetic factors which can lead to different drug efficiency and toxicity among populations are still undisclosed in COVID-19 therapy. We selected 67 potential drugs for COVID-19 therapy (DCTs) from clinical guideline and clinical trials databases. 313 pharmaco-genes related to these therapeutic drugs were included. Variation information in 125,748 exomes were collected for racial differences analyses. The expression level of pharmaco-genes in single cell resolution was evaluated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 17 healthy adults. Results: Pharmacogenes, including CYP3A4, ABCB1, SLCO1B1, ALB, CYP3A5, were involved in the process of more than multi DCTs. 224 potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) of DCTs were predicted, while 112 of them have been reported. Racial discrepancy of common nonsynonymous mutations was found in pharmacogenes including: VDR, ITPA, G6PD, CYP3A4 and ABCB1 which related to DCTs including ribavirin, α -interferon, chloroquine and lopinavir. Moreover, ACE2, the target of 2019-nCoV, was only found in parts of lung cells, which makes drugs like chloroquine that prevent virus binding to ACE2 more specific than other targeted drugs such as camostat mesylate.\n",

Generally, ZIKV transmits through mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) like other flaviviruses, but reports show blood transfusion and sexual mode of ZIKV transmission which further makes the situation alarming. Till date, there is not a single Zika specific licensed drug or vaccine present in the market. However, in recent months, several antiviral molecules have been screened against viral and host proteins. Among those, (−)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green tea polyphenol has shown great virucidal potential against flaviviruses including ZIKV. However, the mechanistic understanding of EGCG targeting viral proteins is not yet entirely deciphered except little is known about its interaction with viral envelope protein and viral protease. Since literature has shown significant inhibitory interactions of EGCG against various kinases and bacterial DNA gyrases; we designed our study to find inhibitory actions of EGCG against ZIKV NS3 helicase. NS3 helicase is playing a significant role in viral replication by unwinding RNA after hydrolyzing NTP. We employed molecular docking and simulation approach and found significant interactions at ATPase site and also at RNA binding site. Further, the enzymatic assay has shown significant inhibition of NTPase activity with an IC50 value of 295.7 nM and Ki of 0.387 ± 0.034 µM. Our study suggests the possibility that EGCG could be considered as prime backbone molecule for further broadspectrum and multitargeted inhibitor development against ZIKV and other flaviviruses. author/funder.

It is urgent to generate new chemical entities against this virus. As a key enzyme in the life-cycle of coronavirus, the 3C-like main protease (3CL pro or M pro ) is the most attractive for antiviral drug design. Based on a recently solved structure (PDB ID: 6LU7), we developed a novel advanced deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug design (ADQN-FBDD) for generating potential lead compounds targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . We obtained a series of derivatives from those lead compounds by our structure-based optimization policy (SBOP). All the 47 lead compounds directly from our AI-model and related derivatives based on SBOP are accessible in our molecular library at https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov.

To face the considerable threat of SARS-CoV-2, it is urgent to develop new inhibitors or drugs against this deadly virus. Unfortunately, since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) eighteen years ago, there has been no approved treatment against the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 3 which is similar to SARS-CoV-2. Repurposing potential drugs such as lopinavir and ritonavir also failed to SARS-CoV-2 injected patients. 4 Structure-based antiviral drug design with a new artificial intelligence algorithm may represent a more helpful approach to get the SARS-CoV-2 targeted inhibitors or drugs. Thanks to the prompt efforts of many researchers, we have several pieces of important information about this vital virus genome and protein structures. We now know that the non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5) is the main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 and it is a cysteine protease, which also been called \"3C-like protease\" (3CL pro ). Moreover, we know that the 3D structure of 3CL pro is very similar to SARS-CoV with a sequence identity of >96% and 3D structure superposition RMSDCα of 0.44 Å as shown in Figures S1 and S2. 3CL pro has been reported as an attractive target for developing anti-coronaviral drugs: 1) this protease is highly conserved in both sequences and 3D structures; 5 2) 3CL pro is a key enzyme for related virus (including SARS and SARS-CoV-2) replication; 3) it only exists in the virus, not in humans. Developing specific antiviral drugs targeting 3CL pro of the specific virus has shown significant success; for example, both approved drugs lopinavir and ritonavir can completely occupy the substrate-binding site of 3CL pro to break down the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, due to the large difference between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , lopinavir and ritonavir were validated ineffective for inhibiting SARS-Cov-2. 4 On the other hand, the substrate-binding site of 3CL pro is almost the same between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS as Figure S3 presents. The developed potential inhibitors and drug-design experience targeting SARS-3CL pro may also be applicable to SARS-CoV-2. For author/funder. All rights reserved.

Herein, the FEP (free energy perturbation)-based screening strategy is newly derived as a rapid protocol to accurately reposition potential agents against COVID-19 by targeting viral proteinase Mpro. Restrain energy distribution (RED) function was derived to optimize the alchemical pathway of FEP, which greatly accelerated the calculations and first made FEP possible in the virtual screening of the FDA-approved drugs database. As a result, fifteen out of twenty-five drugs validated in vitro exhibited considerable inhibitory potencies towards Mpro. Among them, the most potent Mpro inhibitor dipyridamole potentially inhibited NF-B signaling pathway and inflammatory responses, and has just finished the first round clinical trials.
